      <p>Crito, Socrates</p>
      <p>
        <b>Crito:</b> Who was it, Socrates, that you were talking with yesterday
        at the Lyceum? Why, there was such a crowd standing about you that when
        I came up in the hope of listening I could hear nothing distinctly:
        still, by craning over I got a glimpse, and it appeared to me that it
        was a stranger with whom you were talking. Who was he?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> About which are you asking, Crito? There were two of
        them, not one.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> The man whom I mean was sitting next but one to you, on
        your right:
      </p>

      <p>
        between you was Axiochus' boy; and he, Socrates, seemed to me to have
        grown a great deal, so as to look almost the same age as my Critobulus,
        who is rather puny whereas this boy has come on finely, and has a noble
        air about him.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Euthydemus is the person to whom you refer, Crito, and
        the one sitting on my left was his brother, Dionysodorus. He too takes
        part in our discussions.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Neither of them is known to me, Socrates. A pair of fresh
        additions,
      </p>

      <p>
        I suppose, to our sophists. Where do they hail from, and what science do
        they profess?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> By birth I believe they belong to these parts, that is
        to say, Chios; they went out as colonists to Thurii, but have been
        exiled thence and have spent a good many years now in various parts of
        this country. As to what you ask of their profession, it is a wonderful
        one, Crito. These two men are absolutely omniscient: I never knew before
        what “all-round sportsmen” were. They are a pair of regular all-round
        fighters—not in the style of the famous all-round athletes, the two
        brothers of Acamania;
      </p>

      <p>
        they could fight with their bodies only. But these two, in the first
        place, are most formidable in body and in fight against all comers—for
        they are not only well skilled themselves in fighting under arms,
      </p>

      <p>
        but are able to impart that skill, for a fee, to another; and further,
        they are most competent also to fight the battle of the law-courts and
        teach others how to speak, or to have composed for them, such speeches
        as may win their suits. Formerly they had merely some ability for this;
        but now they have put the finishing touch to their skill as all-round
        sportsmen. The one feat of fighting yet unperformed by them they have
        now accomplished, so that nobody dares stand up to them for a moment;
        such a faculty they have acquired for wielding words as their weapons
        and confuting any argument as readily
      </p>

      <p>
        if it be true as if it be false. And so I, Crito, am minded to place
        myself in these two gentlemen's hands; for they say it would take them
        but a little while to make anyone else clever in just the same way.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> What, Socrates! Are you not afraid, at your time of life,
        that you may be too old for that now?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Not at all, Crito: I have enough proof and reassurance
        to the contrary. These same two persons were little less than old men at
        the time of their taking up this science, which I desire to have, of
        disputation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year, or the year before, they were as yet without their science.
        The only thing I am afraid of is that I may bring the same disgrace upon
        our two visitors as upon Connus, son of Metrobius, the harper, who is
        still trying to teach me the harp; so that the boys who go to his
        lessons with me make fun of me and call Connus “the gaffers' master.”
        This makes me fear that someone may make the same reproach to the two
        strangers; and, for aught I know, their dread of this very thing may
        make them unwilling to accept me. So, Crito, just as in the other case I
        have persuaded some elderly men to come and have lessons with me,
      </p>

      <p>
        in this affair I am going to try and persuade another set. Now you, I am
        sure, will come with me to school; and we will take your sons as a bait
        to entice them, for I have no doubt that the attraction of these young
        fellows will make them include us also in the class.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> I have no objection, Socrates, if you think fit to do so.
        But first you must explain to me what is the science these men profess,
        that I may know what it is we are going to learn.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> You shall be told at once; for I cannot plead that I
        did not give them my attention, since I not only attended closely but
        remember and will try
      </p>

      <p>
        to expound the whole thing from the beginning. By some providence I
        chanced to be sitting in the place where you saw me, in the
        undressing-room, alone, and was just intending to get up and go; but the
        moment I did so, there came my wonted spiritual sign. So I sat down
        again,
      </p>

      <p>
        and after a little while these two persons entered—Euthydemus and
        Dionysodorus—and accompanying them, quite a number, as it seemed to me,
        of their pupils: the two men came in and began walking round inside the
        cloister. Hardly had they taken two or three turns, when in stepped
        Cleinias, who you say has come on so much, and you are right: behind him
        was a whole troop of lovers, and among them Ctesippus, a young fellow
        from Paeania, of gentle birth and breeding, except for a certain
        insolence of youth.
      </p>

      <p>
        So when Cleinias as he entered caught sight of me sitting there alone,
        he came straight across and sat beside me on my right, just as you say.
        Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, when they saw him, stood at first talking
        with each other, and casting an occasional glance at us—for my attention
        was fixed on them—but then one of them, Euthydemus, took a seat by the
        youth, and the other next to me on my left; the rest, where each
        happened to find one.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I greeted the two brothers, as not having seen them for some time;
        after that I said to Cleinias: My dear Cleinias, these two men, you
        know, are skilled not in little things, but in great. For they
        understand all about war, that is, as much as is needful for him who is
        to be a good general; both the tactics and the strategy of armies, and
        all the teaching of troops under arms; and they can also enable one to
        get redress in the law courts for a wrong that one may have suffered.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When I had said this,
      </p>

      <p>
        I saw they despised me for it, and they both laughed, looking at each
        other; then Euthydemus said: No, no, Socrates, we do not make those
        matters our business now; we deal with them as diversions.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this I wondered and said: Your business must be a fine one, if such
        great matters are indeed diversions to you; so I beseech you, tell me
        what this fine business is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Virtue, Socrates, he replied, is what we deem ourselves able to purvey
        in a pre-eminently excellent and speedy manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good heavens, I exclaimed, a mighty affair indeed! Where did you have
        the luck to pick it up? I was still considering you, as I remarked just
        now, to be chiefly skilled in fighting under arms, and so spoke of you
        in those terms: for when you visited, our city before, this, I
        recollect, was the profession you made. But if you now in truth possess
        this other knowledge, have mercy—you see I address you just as though
        you were a couple of gods, beseeching you to forgive my former remarks.
      </p>

      <p>
        But make sure, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, that you spoke the truth:
        for the vastness of your promise gives me some excuse for disbelieving.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You may be sure, Socrates, they replied, it is as we say.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then I congratulate you on your acquisition far more than I do the great
        king on his empire: only tell me whether you intend to exhibit this
        science of yours, or what you have determined to do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We are here for the very purpose, Socrates, of exhibiting
      </p>

      <p>
        and expounding it to anyone who wishes to learn.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I guarantee that all who do not possess it will wish to—myself to
        begin with, then Cleinias here and, besides us, Ctesippus and all these
        others, I said, showing him the lovers of Cleinias, who were by this
        time standing about us. For Ctesippus, as it happened, was sitting some
        way from Cleinias, I noticed; and by chance, as Euthydemus leant forward
      </p>

      <p>
        in talking to me he obscured Ctesipus' view of Cleinias, who was between
        us. Then Ctesippus, desiring to gaze on his favorite and being also an
        eager listener, led the way by jumping up and placing himself opposite
        us; and this made the others, on seeing what he did, stand around us,
        both Cleinias' lovers and the followers of Euthydemus and Dionysodorus.
        Pointing to these, I told Euthydemus that they were all ready to learn;
        to which Ctesippus assented with great eagerness,
      </p>

      <p>
        and so did the rest; and they all joined in urging the two men to
        exhibit the power of their wisdom.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        On this I remarked: My good Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, you must do
        your very best to gratify my friends and, for my sake also, to give us
        an exhibition. To do it in full, of course, would obviously be a lengthy
        performance: but tell me one thing—will you be able to make a good man
        of him only who is already convinced that he should learn of you,
      </p>

      <p>
        or of him also who is not yet so convinced, owing to an absolute
        disbelief that virtue is a thing that can be learnt or that you are
        teachers of it? Come now, is it the business of this same art to
        persuade such a man that virtue is teachable and that you are the men of
        whom one may best learn it, or does this need some other art?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, this same one can do it, Socrates, said Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then you two, Dionysodorus, I said, would be the best persons now on
        earth to incite one to the pursuit of knowledge
      </p>

      <p>
        and the practice of virtue?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We think so, at least, Socrates.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, please defer the display of all the rest to some other
        occasion, I said, and exhibit this one thing. You are to persuade this
        young fellow here that he ought to ensue wisdom and practise virtue, and
        so you will oblige both me and all these present. This youth happens to
        be in just the sort of condition I speak of; and I and all of us here
        are at this moment anxious for him to become as good as possible. He is
        the son of Axiochus, son of the former Alcibiades,
      </p>

      <p>
        and is own cousin to the Alcibiades that now is: his name is Cleinias.
        He is young; and so we have fears for him, as well one may for a young
        man, lest someone forestall us and turn his inclination to some other
        course of life, and so corrupt him. Hence your arrival now is most
        happy. Come now, if it is all the same to you, make trial of the lad and
        talk with him in our presence.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When I had thus spoken, in almost these very words, Euthydemus answered
        in a tone both manly and dashing: Oh, it is all the same to us,
      </p>

      <p>
        Socrates, provided the youth is willing to answer us.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, in fact, I said, that is just what he is used to: these people here
        are constantly coming to him and asking him a number of questions and
        debating with him, so he is a fairly fearless answerer.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What ensued, Crito, how am I to relate in proper style? For no slight
        matter it is to be able to recall in description such enormous knowledge
        as theirs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consequently, like the poets, I must needs begin my narrative with an
        invocation of the Muses and Memory. Well, Euthydemus set to work, so far
        as I remember, in terms very much the same as these: Cleinias, which
        sort of men are the learners, the wise or the foolish?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this the young man, feeling the embarrassment of the question,
        blushed and glanced at me in his helplessness. So I, perceiving his
        confusion, said: Have no fear, Cleinias; answer bravely,
      </p>

      <p>
        whichever you think it is: for perchance he is doing you the greatest
        service in the world.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Meanwhile Dionysodorus leant over a little to me, with a broad smile on
        his face, and whispered in my ear: Let me tell you, Socrates, beforehand
        that, whichever way the lad answers, he will be confuted.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        While he was saying this, Cleinias made his reply, so that I was unable
        even to advise
      </p>

      <p>
        the boy to be wary: he replied that it was the wise who were the
        learners.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Euthydemus asked: And are there persons whom you call teachers, or
        not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed that there were.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And the teachers of the learners are teachers in the same way as your
        lute-master and your writing-master, I suppose, were teachers of you and
        the other boys, while you were pupils?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now, of course, when you were learning, you did not yet know the things
        you were learning?
      </p>

      <p>
        No, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So were you wise, when you did not know those things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, to be sure, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then if not wise, foolish?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So when you learnt what you did not know, you learnt while being
        foolish.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To this the lad nodded assent.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Hence it is the foolish who learn, Cleinias, and not the wise, as you
        suppose.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When he had thus spoken, all those followers of Dionysodorus
      </p>

      <p>
        and Euthydemus raised a cheer and a laugh, like a chorus at the signal
        of their director; and before the boy could fairly and fully recover his
        breath Dionysodorus took up the cudgels and said: Well now, Cleinias,
        whenever your writing-master dictated from memory, which of the boys
        learnt the piece recited, the wise or the foolish?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        The wise, said Cleinias.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So it is the wise who learn, and not the foolish: hence the answer you
        gave just now to Euthydemus was a bad one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thereupon arose a great deal of laughter and loud applause from the
        pair's adorers, in admiration of their cleverness; while we on our side
        were dismayed and held our peace. Then Euthydemus, observing our dismay,
        and seeking to astonish us still further, would not let the boy go, but
        went on questioning him and, like a skilful dancer, gave a twofold twist
        to his questions on the same point: Now, do the learners learn what they
        know, he asked, or what they do not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Dionysodorus whispered to me again softly:
      </p>

      <p>
        Here comes a second one, Socrates, just like the first.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Heavens! I replied: surely the first question served you well enough.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        All our questions, Socrates, he said, are like that; they leave no
        escape.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And consequently, as it seems to me, I remarked, you have this high
        repute among your disciples.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Meanwhile Cleinias answered Euthydemus, that learners learnt what they
        did not know; so he had to meet the same course of questions as before:
      </p>

      <p>
        Well then, asked the other, do you not know your letters?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        All of them?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now when anyone dictates some piece or other, does he not dictate
        letters?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And he dictates things of which you know something, since you know all
        of them?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted this too.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, said the other, surely you do not learn whatever such a person
        dictates; it is rather he who does not know his letters that learns?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, he replied; I learn.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then you learn what you know, since you know all your letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So your answer was not correct, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        The last word was hardly out of Euthydemus' mouth when Dionysodorus
        caught, as it were, the ball of the argument and, aiming at the boy
        again, said: Euthydemus is deceiving you, Cleinias. Tell me, is not
        learning the reception of knowledge of that which one learns?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Cleinias agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And is not knowing, he went on, just having knowledge at the time?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So that not knowing
      </p>

      <p>
        is not yet having knowledge?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed with him.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then are those who receive anything those who have it already, or those
        who have it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Those who have it not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you have admitted that those who do not know belong also to this
        class of those who have it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He nodded assent.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And the learners belong to the class of the receiving and not to that of
        the having?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Hence it is those who do not know that learn, Cleinias, and not those
        who know.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Euthydemus was proceeding to press the youth for the third fall, when I,
      </p>

      <p>
        perceiving the lad was going under, and wishing to give him some
        breathing-space lest he should shame us by losing heart, encouraged him
        with these words: Cleinias, do not be surprised that these arguments
        seem strange to you; for perhaps you do not discern what our two
        visitors are doing to you. They are acting just like the celebrants of
        the Corybantic rites, when they perform the enthronement of the person
        whom they are about to initiate. There, as you know, if you have been
        through it, they have dancing and merrymaking: so here these two
      </p>

      <p>
        are merely dancing about you and performing their sportive gambols with
        a view to your subsequent initiation. You must now, accordingly, suppose
        you are listening to the first part of the professorial mysteries. First
        of all, as Prodicus says, you have to learn about the correct use of
        words—the very point that our two visitors are making plain to you,
        namely, that you were unaware that learning is the name which people
        apply on the one hand to the case of a man who, having originally no
        knowledge about some matter, in course of time receives such knowledge;
      </p>

      <p>
        and on the other hand the same word is applied when, having the
        knowledge already, he uses that knowledge for the investigation of the
        same matter whether occurring in action or in speech. It is true that
        they tend rather to call it “understanding” than “learning”, but
        occasionally they call it learning too; and this point, as our friends
        are demonstrating, has escaped your notice—how the same word is used for
        people who are in the opposite conditions of knowing and not knowing. A
        similar point underlay the second question, where they asked you
      </p>

      <p>
        whether people learn what they know, or what they do not. Such things
        are the sport of the sciences—and that is why I tell you these men are
        making game of you; I call it sport because, although one were to learn
        many or even all of such tricks, one would be not a whit the wiser as to
        the true state of the matters in hand, but only able to make game of
        people, thanks to the difference in the sense of the words, by tripping
        them up and overturning them; just as those who slyly pull stools away
        from persons who are about to sit down
      </p>

      <p>
        make merry and laugh when they see one sprawling on one's back. So far,
        then, you are to regard these gentlemen's treatment of you as mere play:
        but after this they will doubtless display to you their own serious
        object, while I shall keep them on the track and see that they fulfil
        the promise they gave me. They said they would exhibit their skill in
        exhortation; but instead, I conceive, they thought fit to make sport
        with you first. So now, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus,
      </p>

      <p>
        let us have done with your sport: I daresay you have had as much as you
        want. What you have next to do is to give us a display of exhorting this
        youth as to how he should devote himself to wisdom and virtue. But first
        I shall explain to you how I regard this matter and how I desire to hear
        it dealt with. If I strike you as treating it in a crude and ridiculous
        manner, do not laugh me to scorn; for in my eagerness
      </p>

      <p>
        to listen to your wisdom I shall venture to improvise in your presence.
        So both you and your disciples must restrain yourselves and listen
        without laughing; and you, son of Axiochus, answer me this:
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do all we human beings wish to prosper? Or is this question one of the
        absurdities I was afraid of just now? For I suppose it is stupid merely
        to ask such things, since every man must wish to prosper.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone in the world, said Cleinias.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, I asked, as to the next step, since we wish to prosper, how
        can we prosper? Will it be if we have many good things? Or is this an
        even sillier question than the other? For surely this too must obviously
        be so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Come now, of things that are, what sort do we hold to be really good ?
        Or does it appear to be no difficult matter, and no problem for an
        important person, to find here too a ready answer? Anyone will tell us
        that to be rich is good, surely?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite true, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then it is the same with being healthy and handsome, and having the
        other bodily endowments
      </p>

      <p>
        in plenty?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Again, it is surely clear that good birth and talents and distinctions
        in one's own country are good things.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then what have we still remaining, I asked, in the class of goods? What
        of being temperate, and just, and brave? I bay you tell me, Cleinias, do
        you think we shall be right in ranking these as goods, or in rejecting
        them? For it may be that someone will dispute it. How does it strike
        you?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They are goods; said Cleinias.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Very well, I went on,
      </p>

      <p>
        and where in the troupe shall we station wisdom? Among the goods, or
        how?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Among the goods.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then take heed that we do not pass over any of the goods that may
        deserve mention.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do not think we are leaving any out, said Cleinias.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Hereupon I recollected one and said: Yes, by Heaven, we are on the verge
        of omitting the greatest of the goods.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What is that? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Good fortune, Cleinias: a thing which all men, even the worst fools,
        refer to as the greatest of goods.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You are right, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Once again I reconsidered and said:
      </p>

      <p>
        We have almost made ourselves laughing-stocks, you and I, son of
        Axiochus, for our visitors.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What is wrong now? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, after putting good fortune in our former list, we have just been
        discussing the same thing again.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What is the point?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Surely it is ridiculous, when a thing has been before us all the time,
        to set it forth again and go over the same ground twice.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To what are you referring? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Wisdom, I replied, is presumably good fortune: even a child could see
        that.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He wondered at this—he is still so young and simple-minded: then I,
        perceiving his surprise, went on: Can you be unaware,
      </p>

      <p>
        Cleinias, that for success in flute-music it is the flute-players that
        have the best fortune?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed to this.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then in writing and reading letters it will be the schoolmasters.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, for the dangers of a sea-voyage, do you consider any pilots to
        he more fortunate, as a general rule, than the wise ones?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, to be sure.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, then, suppose you were on a campaign, with which kind of general
        would you prefer to share both the peril and the luck—a wise one, or an
        ignorant?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        With a wise one.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, supposing you were sick, with which kind of doctor would you
        like to venture yourself a wise one, or an ignorant?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        With a wise one.
      </p>

      <p>
        And your reason, I said, is this, that you would fare with better
        fortune in the hands of a wise one than of an ignorant one?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So that wisdom everywhere causes men to be fortunate: since I presume
        she could never err, but must needs be right in act and result;
        otherwise she could be no longer wisdom.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We came to an agreement somehow or other
      </p>

      <p>
        in the end that the truth in general was this: when wisdom is present,
        he with whom it is present has no need of good fortune as well; and as
        we had agreed on this I began to inquire of him over again what we
        should think, in this case, of our previous agreements. For we agreed,
        said I, that if many goods were present to us we should be happy and
        prosper.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then would we be happy because of our present goods, if they gave us no
        benefit, or if they gave us some?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        If they gave us benefit, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And would a thing benefit us if we merely had it
      </p>

      <p>
        and did not use it? For instance, if we had a lot of provisions, but did
        not eat them, or liquor, and did not drink it, could we be said to be
        benefited?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Of course not, he answered.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, if every craftsman found the requisites for his particular
        work all ready prepared for him, and then made no use of them, would he
        prosper because of these acquisitions, as having acquired all the things
        necessary for a craftsman to have at hand? For example, if a carpenter
        were furnished with all his tools and a good supply of wood, but did no
        carpentry, is it possible he could be benefited
      </p>

      <p>
        by what he had got?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, suppose a man had got wealth and all the goods that we
        mentioned just now, but made no use of them; would he be happy because
        of his possessing these goods?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Surely not, Socrates.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So it seems one must not merely have acquired such goods if one is to be
        happy, but use them too; else there is no benefit gained from their
        possession.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        True.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then have we here enough means,
      </p>

      <p>
        Cleinias, for making a man happy—in the possession of these goods and
        using them?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I think so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Shall we say, I asked, if he uses them rightly, or just as much if he
        does not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        If rightly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well answered, I said; for I suppose there is more mischief when a man
        uses anything wrongly than when he lets it alone. In the one case there
        is evil; in the other there is neither evil
      </p>

      <p>
        nor good. May we not state it so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To proceed then: in the working and use connected with wood, is there
        anything else that effects the right use than the knowledge of
        carpentry? Surely not, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Further, I presume that in the working connected with furniture it is
        knowledge that effects the right work.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then similarly, I went on, in the use of the goods we mentioned at
        first—wealth and health and beauty—was it knowledge that showed the way
        to the right use of all those advantages
      </p>

      <p>
        and rectified their conduct, or was it something else?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Knowledge, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So that knowledge, it would seem, supplies mankind not only with good
        luck, but with welfare, in all that he either possesses or conducts.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then can we, in Heaven's name, get any benefit from all the other
        possessions without understanding and wisdom? Shall we say that a man
        will profit more by possessing much and doing much when he has no sense,
        than he will if he does and possesses little? Consider it this way:
      </p>

      <p>
        would he not err less if he did less; and so, erring less, do less ill;
        and hence, doing less ill, be less miserable?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In which of the two cases, when one is poor or when one is rich, will
        one be more likely to do less?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When one is poor, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And when one is weak, or when one is strong?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Weak.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And when one has high position, or has none?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        None.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When one is brave and self-controlled, will one do less, or when one is
        a coward?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        A coward.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So too, when idle rather than busy?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And slow rather than quick,
      </p>

      <p>
        and dim of sight and hearing rather than sharp?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We agreed with each other as to these and all such cases.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To sum up then, Cleinias, I proceeded, it seems that, as regards the
        whole lot of things which at first we termed goods, the discussion they
        demand is not on the question of how they are in themselves and by
        nature goods, but rather, I conceive, as follows: if they are guided by
        ignorance, they are greater evils than their opposites, according as
        they are more capable of ministering to their evil guide; whereas if
        understanding and wisdom guide them,
      </p>

      <p>
        they are greater goods; but in themselves neither sort is of any worth.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I think the case appears, he replied, to be as you suggest.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now what result do we get from our statements? Is it not precisely that,
        of all the other things, not one is either good or bad, but of these
        two, wisdom is good and ignorance bad?
      </p>

      <p>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Let us consider then, I said, the further conclusion that lies before
        us. Since we are all eager to be happy, and since we were found to
        become so by not only using things but using them aright, while
        knowledge, we saw, was that which provided the rightness and good
        fortune, it seems that every man must prepare himself by all available
        means so that he may be as wise as possible. Is it not so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And if a man thinks, as well he may,
      </p>

      <p>
        that he ought to get this endowment from his father much more than
        money, and also from his guardians and his ordinary friends, and from
        those who profess to be his lovers, whether strangers or
        fellow-citizens—praying and beseeching them to give him his share of
        wisdom; there is no disgrace, Cleinias, or reprobation in making this a
        reason for serving and being a slave to either one's lover or any man,
        and being ready to perform any service that is honorable in one's
        eagerness to become wise. Is not this your view? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I think you are
      </p>

      <p>
        perfectly right, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, Cleinias, I went on, if wisdom is teachable, and does not present
        itself to mankind of its own accord—for this is a question that we have
        still to consider as not yet agreed on by you and me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        For my part, Socrates, he said, I think it is teachable.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this I was glad, and said: Well spoken indeed, my excellent friend!
        How good of you to relieve me of a long inquiry into this very point,
        whether wisdom is teachable or not teachable! So now, since you think it
        is both teachable and
      </p>

      <p>
        the only thing in the world that makes man happy and fortunate, can you
        help saying that it is necessary to pursue wisdom or intending to pursue
        it yourself?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, said he, I do say so, Socrates, with all my might.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So I, delighted to hear this, said: There, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus,
        is my illustration of what I desire a hortatory argument to be—rough and
        ready, perhaps, and expressed at laborious length: now let either of you
        who wishes to do so give us an example of an artist's handling of this
        same matter. If you do not wish to do that,
      </p>

      <p>
        let your display begin where I left off, and show the lad whether he
        ought to acquire every kind of knowledge, or whether there is a single
        sort of it which one must obtain if one is to be both happy and a good
        man, and what it is. For as I was saying at the outset, it really is a
        matter of great moment to us that this youth should become
      </p>

      <p>
        wise and good.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        These were my words, Crito; and I set about giving the closest attention
        to what should follow, and observing in what fashion they would deal
        with the question, and how they would start exhorting the youth to
        practise wisdom and virtue. So then the elder of them, Dionysodorus,
        entered first upon the discussion, and we all turned our eyes on him
        expecting to hear, there and then, some wonderful arguments. And this
        result we certainly got;
      </p>

      <p>
        for wondrous, in a way, Crito, was the argument that the man then
        ushered forth, which is worth your hearing as a notable incitement to
        virtue.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Tell me, Socrates, he said, and all you others who say you desire this
        youth to become wise, whether you say this in jest or truly and
        earnestly desire it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this I reflected that previously, as it seemed, they took us to be
        jesting, when we urged them to converse with the youth, and hence they
        made a jest of it
      </p>

      <p>
        and did not take it seriously. This reflection therefore made me insist
        all the more that we were in deadly earnest.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Dionysodorus said: Yet be careful, Socrates, that you do not have
        to deny what you say now.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I know what I am about, I said: I know I shall never deny it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, he proceeded; you tell me you wish him to become wise?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And at present, be asked, is Cleinias wise or not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He says he is not yet so—he is no vain pretender.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you, he went on,
      </p>

      <p>
        wish him to become wise, and not to be ignorant?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So you wish him to become what he is not, and to be no longer what he
        now is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When I heard this I was confused; and he, striking in on my confusion,
        said: Of course then, since you wish him to be no longer what he now is,
        you wish him, apparently, to be dead. And yet what valuable friends and
        lovers they must be, who would give anything to know their darling was
        dead and gone!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ctesippus, on hearing this, was annoyed on his favorite's account, and
        said: Stranger of Thurii, were it not rather a rude thing to say, I
        should tell you, ill betide your design of speaking so falsely of me and
        my friends as to make out—what to me is almost too profane even to
        repeat—that I could wish this boy to be dead and gone!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, Ctesippus, said Euthydemus, do you think it possible to lie?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To be sure, I do, he replied: I should be mad otherwise.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do you mean, when one tells the thing about which
      </p>

      <p>
        one is telling, or when one does not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When one tells it, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then if you tell it, you tell just that thing which you tell, of all
        that are, and nothing else whatever?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Of course, said Ctesippus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now the thing that you tell is a single one, distinct from all the
        others there are.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then the person who tells that thing tells that which is?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But yet, surely he who tells what is, and things that are, tells the
        truth: so that Dionysodorus, if he tells things that are, tells the
        truth and speaks no lie about you.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, said Ctesippus;
      </p>

      <p>
        but he who speaks as he did, Euthydemus, does not say things that are.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Euthydemus asked him: And the things which are not, surely are not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They are not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then nowhere can the things that are not be?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nowhere.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then is it possible for anyone whatever so to deal with these things
        that are not as to make them be when they are nowhere?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I think not, said Ctesippus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, when orators speak before the people, do they do nothing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, they do something, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then if they do,
      </p>

      <p>
        they also make?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now, is speaking doing and making?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed that it is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No one, I suppose, speaks what is not—for thereby he would be making
        something; and you have agreed that one cannot so much as make what is
        not—so that, by your account, no one speaks what is false, while if
        Dionysodorus speaks, he speaks what is true and is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, in faith, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus; but somehow or other he
        speaks what is, only not as it is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How do you mean, Ctesippus? said Dionysodorus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Are there persons who tell things as they are?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why surely, he replied, there are gentlemen—people who speak the truth?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, he went on, good things are in good case, bad in bad, are they
        not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you admit that gentlemen tell things as they are.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then, Ctesippus, good people speak evil of evil things, if they speak of
        them as they are.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I can tell you, very much so, when for instance they speak of evil
        men; among whom, if you take my advice,
      </p>

      <p>
        you will beware of being included, that the good may not speak ill of
        you. For, I assure you, the good speak ill of the evil.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And they speak greatly of the great, asked Euthydemus, and hotly of the
        hot?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, I presume, said Ctesippus: I know they speak frigidly of the
        frigid, and call their way of arguing frigid.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You are turning abusive, Ctesippus, said Dionysodorus, quite abusive!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not I, on my soul, Dionysodorus, for I like you: I am only giving you a
        friendly hint, and endeavoring to persuade you never to say anything so
        tactless in my presence as
      </p>

      <p>
        that I wish these my most highly valued friends to be dead and gone.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So then I, observing that they were getting rather savage with each
        other, began to poke fun. at Ctesippus, saying: Ctesippus, my feeling is
        that we ought to accept from our visitors what they tell us, if they are
        so good as to give it, and should not quarrel over a word. For if they
        understand how to do away with people in such sort as to change them
        from wicked and witless to honest and intelligent, and that too whether
        they have discovered for themselves
      </p>

      <p>
        or learnt from somebody else this peculiar kind of destruction or
        undoing, which enables them to destroy a man in his wickedness and set
        him up again in honesty; if they understand this—and obviously they do;
        you know they said that their newly discovered art was to turn wicked
        men into good—let us then accord them this power; let them destroy the
        lad for us, and make him sensible, and all the rest of us likewise. If
        you young fellows are afraid, let the experiment be made on me
      </p>

      <p>
        as a “corpus vile” ; for I, being an elderly person, am ready to take
        the risk and put myself in the hands of Dionysodorus here, as if he were
        the famous Medea of Colchis. Let him destroy me, and if he likes let him
        boil me down, or do to me whatever he pleases: only he must make me
        good.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Ctesippus said: I too, Socrates, am ready to offer myself to be
        skinned by the strangers even more, if they choose, than they are doing
        now, if my hide
      </p>

      <p>
        is not to end by being made into a wine-skin, like that of Marsyas, but
        into the shape of virtue. And yet Dionysodorus here believes I am vexed
        with him. I am not vexed at all; I only contradict the remarks which I
        think he has improperly aimed at me. Come now, my generous Dionysodorus,
        do not call contradiction abuse: abuse is quite another thing.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        On this Dionysodorus said: As though there were such a thing as
        contradiction! Is that the way you argue, Ctesippus?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, to be sure, he replied, indeed I do; and do you, Dionysodorus,
      </p>

      <p>
        hold that there is not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, you at any rate, he said, could not prove that you had ever heard
        a single person contradicting another.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Is that so? he replied: well, let us hear now whether I can prove a case
        of it—Ctesippus contradicting Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now, will you make that good?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, proceeded the other, each thing that is has its own
        description?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you mean,
      </p>

      <p>
        as each is, or as it is not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        As it is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said, for if you recollect, Ctesippus, we showed just now that
        no one speaks of a thing as it is not; since we saw that no one speaks
        what is not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, what of that? asked Ctesippus: are you and I contradicting any the
        less?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now tell me, he said, could we contradict if we both spoke the
        description of the same thing? In this case should we not surely speak
        the same words?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But when neither of us speaks the description of the thing, he asked,
      </p>

      <p>
        then we should contradict? Or in this case shall we say that neither of
        us touched on the matter at all?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        This also he admitted.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, when I for my part speak the description of the thing, while
        you give another of another thing, do we contradict then? Or do I
        describe the thing, while you do not describe it at all? How can he who
        does not describe contradict him who does?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this Ctesippus was silent; but I, wondering at the argument, said:
        How do you mean, Dionysodorus?
      </p>

      <p>
        For, to be plain with you, this argument, though I have heard it from
        many people on various occasions, never fails to set me wondering—you
        know the followers of Protagoras made great use of it, as did others
        even before his time, but to me it always seems to have a wonderful way
        of upsetting not merely other views but itself also—and I believe I
        shall learn the truth of it from you far better than from anyone else.
        There is no such thing as speaking false—that is the substance of your
        statement, is it not? Either one must speak and speak the truth, or else
        not speak?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then shall we say that speaking false “is not,” but thinking false “is”?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, it is the same with thinking, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So neither is there any false opinion, I said, at all.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nor ignorance, nor ignorant men; or must not ignorance occur, if it ever
        can, when we put things falsely?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But there is no such thing as this, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Is it merely to save your statement, Dionysodorus, that you state it
        so—just to say something startling—or is it really and truly your view
        that there is no such thing as an ignorant man?
      </p>

      <p>
        But you, he replied, are to refute me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, does your argument allow of such a thing as refutation, if there
        is nobody to speak false?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There is no such thing, said Euthydemus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So neither did Dionysodorus just now bid me refute him? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, for how can one bid something that is not? Do you bid such a thing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, Euthydemus, I said, it is because I do not at all understand these
        clever devices and palpable hits: I am only a dull sort of thinker. And
        so I may perhaps be going to say something rather clownish; but you must
        forgive me. Here it is:
      </p>

      <p>
        if there is no such thing as speaking false or thinking false or being
        stupid, surely there can be no making a mistake either, when one does
        something. For in doing it there is no mistaking the thing that is done.
        You will state it so, will you not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        My clownish question, I went on, is now already before you. If we make
        no mistake either in doing or saying or intending, I ask you what in
        Heaven's name, on that assumption, is the subject you two set up to
        teach. Or did you not say just now that your speciality was to put any
        man who wished
      </p>

      <p>
        in the way of learning virtue?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now really, Socrates, interposed Dionysodorus, are you such an old
        dotard as to recollect now what we said at first, and will you now
        recollect what I may have said last year, and yet be at a loss how to
        deal with the arguments urged at the moment?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, you see, I replied, they are so very hard, and naturally so; for
        they fall from the lips of wise men; and this is further shown by the
        extreme difficulty of dealing with this last one you put forward. For
        what on earth do you mean, Dionysodorus, by saying I am at a loss how to
        deal with it? Or is it clear that
      </p>

      <p>
        you mean I am at a loss how to refute it? You must tell me what else
        your phrase can intend, “at a loss how to deal with the arguments.”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But it is not so very hard to deal with that phrase of yours, he said.
        Just answer me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Before you answer me, Dionysodorus? I protested.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You refuse to answer? he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Is it fair?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Oh yes, it is fair enough, he replied
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        On what principle? I asked: or is it plainly on this one—that you
        present yourself to us at this moment as universally skilled in
        discussion, and thus can tell when an answer is to be given, and when
        not? So now you will not answer a word,
      </p>

      <p>
        because you discern that you ought not to.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What nonsense you talk, he said, instead of answering as you should.
        Come, good sir, do as I bid you and answer, since you confess to my
        wisdom.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, I must obey, I said, and of necessity, it seems; for you are
        the master here. Now for your question.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then tell me, do things that “intend” have life when they intend, or do
        lifeless things do it too?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Only those that have life.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now do you know any phrase that has life?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Upon my soul, I do not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why then did you ask just now what my phrase intended?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Of course I made a great mistake, I said: I am such a dullard. Or
        perhaps it was not a mistake, and I was right in saying what I did, that
        phrases intend. Do you say I was mistaken or not? If I was not, then you
        will not refute me, with all your skill, and you are at a loss how to
        deal with the argument; while if I was mistaken, you are in the wrong
        there, too,
      </p>

      <p>
        for you assert that there is no such thing as making a mistake; and what
        I say is not aimed at what you said last year. But it seems, I went on,
        Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, that our argument remains just where it
        was, and still suffers from the old trouble of knocking others down and
        then falling itself, and even your art has not yet discovered a way of
        avoiding this failure—in spite, too, of the wonderful show it makes of
        accurate reasoning.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here Ctesippus exclaimed: Yes, your way of discussion is marvellous,
      </p>

      <p>
        you men of Thurii or Chios or wherever or however it is you are pleased
        to get your names; for you have no scruple about babbling like fools.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this I was afraid we might hear some abuse, so I soothed Ctesippus
        down once more, saying: Ctesippus, I repeat to you what I said to
        Cleinias just now, that you do not perceive the wonderful nature of our
        visitors' skill. Only they are unwilling to give us a display of it in
        real earnest, but treat us to jugglers' tricks in the style of Proteus
        the Egyptian adept.
      </p>

      <p>
        So let us take our cue from Menelaus, and not leave hold of these
        gentlemen till they give us a sight of their own serious business. I
        believe something very fine will be found in them as soon as they begin
        to be serious. Come, let us beg and exhort and beseech them to let their
        light shine. For my part, then, I am minded to take the lead once more
        in showing what sort of persons I pray may be revealed in them:
      </p>

      <p>
        starting from where I left off before, I shall try, as best I can, to
        describe what follows on from that, to see if I can rouse them to action
        and make them, in merciful commensuration of my earnest endeavor, be
        earnest themselves.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Will you, Cleinias, I asked, please remind me of the point at which we
        left off? Now, as far as I can tell, it was something like this: we
        ended by agreeing that one ought to pursue wisdom, did we not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And this pursuit—called philosophy—is an acquiring of knowledge. Is it
        not so? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then what knowledge should we acquire if we acquired it rightly?
      </p>

      <p>
        Is it not absolutely clear that it must be that knowledge which will
        profit us?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now will it profit us at all, if we know how to tell, as we go about,
        where the earth has most gold buried in it?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Perhaps, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But yet, I went on, we refuted that former proposition, agreeing that
        even if without any trouble or digging the earth we got all the gold in
        the world, we should gain nothing, so that not if we knew how
      </p>

      <p>
        to turn the rocks into gold would our knowledge be of any worth. For
        unless we know how to use the gold, we found no advantage in it. Do you
        not remember? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly I do, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nor, it seems, do we get any advantage from all other knowledge, whether
        of money-making or medicine or any other that knows how to make things,
        without knowing how to use the thing made. Is it not so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nor again, if there is a knowledge
      </p>

      <p>
        enabling one to make men immortal, does this, if we lack the knowledge
        how to use immortality, seem to bring any advantage either, if we are to
        infer anything from our previous admissions.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        On all these points we agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then the sort of knowledge we require, fair youth, I said, is that in
        which there happens to be a union of making and knowing how to use the
        thing made.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So we ought, it seems, to aim at something far other than being
        lyre-makers
      </p>

      <p>
        or possessing that kind of knowledge. For in this case the art that
        makes and the art that uses are quite distinct, dealing in separation
        with the same thing; since there is a wide difference between the art of
        making lyres and that of harp-playing. Is it not so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nor again, obviously, do we require an art of flute-making; for this is
        another of the same kind.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now in good earnest, I asked, if we were to learn the art of
        speech-making, can that be the art we should acquire if we would be
        happy?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I for one think not, said Cleinias,
        interposing.
      </p>

      <p>
        On what proof do you rely? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I see, he said, certain speech-writers who do not know how to use the
        special arguments composed by themselves, just as lyre-makers in regard
        to their lyres: in the former case also there are other persons able to
        use what the makers produced, while being themselves unable to make the
        written speech. Hence it is clear that in speech likewise there are two
        distinct arts, one of making and one of using.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I think you give sufficient proof, I said,
        that this art of the speech-writers cannot be that whose acquisition
        would make one happy. And yet I fancied that somewhere about this point
        would appear the knowledge which we have been seeking all this while.
      </p>

      <p>
        For not only do these speech-writers themselves, when I am in their
        company, impress me as prodigiously clever, Cleinias, but their art
        itself seems so exalted as to be almost inspired. However, this is not
        surprising; for it is a part of the sorcerer's art,
      </p>

      <p>
        and only slightly inferior to that. The sorcerer's art is the charming
        of snakes and tarantulas and scorpions and other beasts and diseases,
        while the other is just the charming and soothing of juries, assemblies,
        crowds, and so forth. Or does it strike you differently? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, it appears to me, he replied, to be as you say.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Which way then, said I, shall we turn now? What kind of art shall we
        try?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        For my part, he said, I have no suggestion.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, I think I have found it myself, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What is it? said Cleinias.
      </p>

      <p>
        Generalship, I replied, strikes me as the art whose acquisition above
        all others would make one happy.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do not think so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why not? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In a sense, this is an art of hunting men.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What then? I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No part of actual hunting, he replied, covers more than the province of
        chasing and overcoming; and when they have overcome the creature they
        are chasing, they are unable to use it: the huntsmen or the fishermen
        hand it over to the caterers, and so it is too with the geometers,
        astronomers, and calculators—
      </p>

      <p>
        for these also are hunters in their way, since they are not in each case
        diagram-makers, but discover the realities of things —and so, not
        knowing how to use their prey, but only how to hunt, I take it they hand
        over their discoveries to the dialecticians to use properly, those of
        them, at least, who are not utter blockheads.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Very good, I said, most handsome and ingenious Cleinias; and is this
        really so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To be sure it is; and so, in the same way, with the generals. When they
        have hunted either a city or
      </p>

      <p>
        an army, they hand it over to the politicians—since they themselves do
        not know how to use what they have hunted—just as quail-hunters, I
        suppose, hand over their birds to the quail-keepers. If, therefore, he
        went on, we are looking for that art which itself shall know how to use
        what it has acquired either in making or chasing, and if this is the
        sort that will make us blest, we must reject generalship, he said, and
        seek out some other.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Crito:</b> What is this, Socrates? Such a pronouncement from that
        stripling!
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> You do not believe it is his, Crito?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> I should rather think not. For I am sure, if he spoke
        thus, he has no need of education from Euthydemus or anyone else.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But then, Heaven help me! I wonder if it was Ctesippus
        who said it, and my memory fails me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Crito:</b> Very like Ctesippus!
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Well, of this at any rate I am certain, that it was
        neither Euthydemus nor Dionysodorus who said it. Tell me, mysterious
        Crito, was it some superior power that was there to speak it? For that
        speech I heard, I am sure.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Yes, I promise you, Socrates: I fancy it was indeed some
        superior power—very much so. But after that, did you go on looking for a
        suitable art? Did you find the one which you had as the object of your
        search, or not?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Find it, my good fellow! No, we were in a most
        ridiculous state; like children who run after crested larks, we kept on
        believing each moment we were just going to catch this or that one of
        the knowledges, while they as often slipped from our grasp. What need to
        tell you the story at length? When we reached the kingly art, and were
        examining it to see if we had here what provides and produces happiness,
        at this point we were involved in a labyrinth: when we supposed we had
        arrived at the end, we twisted about again
      </p>

      <p>
        and found ourselves practically at the beginning of our search, and just
        as sorely in want as when we first started on it.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> How did this happen to you, Socrates?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> I will tell you. We took the view that the statesman's
        and the monarch's arts were one and the same.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Well, what then?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> To this art, we thought, generalship and the other arts
        handed over the management of the productions of their own trades, as
        this one alone knew how to use them. So it seemed clear to us that this
        was the one we were seeking,
      </p>

      <p>
        and was the cause of right conduct in the state, and precisely as
        Aeschylus' line expresses it, is seated alone at the helm of the city,
        steering the whole, commanding the whole, and making the whole useful.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> And surely your notion was a good one, Socrates?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> You shall judge of that, Crito, if you care to hear
        what befell us thereafter. For later on we reconsidered it somewhat in
        this manner: Look now, does the monarch's art, that rules over all,
        produce any effect
      </p>

      <p>
        or not? Certainly it does, of course, we said to one another. Would you
        not say so too, Crito?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> I would.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then what would you say is its effect? For instance, if
        I were to ask you whether medicine, in ruling over all that comes under
        its rule, has any effect to show; would you not say: Yes, health?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> I would.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And what about your art of agriculture? In ruling over
        all
      </p>

      <p>
        that comes under its rule, what effect does it produce? Would you not
        say that it supplies us with food from the earth?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> I would.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And what of the monarch's art? In ruling over all that
        comes under its rule, what does it produce? Perhaps you are not quite
        ready with the answer.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> I am not indeed, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Nor were we, Crito; yet so much you know, that if this
        is really the one we are seeking, it must be beneficial.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then surely it must purvey something good?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Necessarily, Socrates.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> And you know we agreed with each other, Cleinias and I,
        that nothing can be good but some sort of knowledge.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Yes, so you told me.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And it was found that all effects in general that you
        may ascribe to statesmanship—and a great many of them there must be,
        presumably, if the citizens are to be made wealthy and free and immune
        from faction—all these things were neither bad nor good, while this art
        must make us wise and impart knowledge, if it really was to be the one
        which benefited us
      </p>

      <p>
        and made us happy.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> True: so at all events you agreed then, by your account of
        the discussion.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then do you think that kingship makes men wise and
        good?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Why not, Socrates?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But does it make all men good, and in all things? And
        is this the art that confers every sort of knowledge—shoe-making and
        carpentry and so forth?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> No, I think not, Socrates.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Well, what knowledge does it give ? What use can we
        make of it? It is not to be a producer of any of the effects which are
        neither bad nor good, while it is to confer no other knowledge but
        itself. Shall we try and say what it is, and what use we shall make of
        it? Do you mind if we describe it, Crito, as that whereby we shall make
        other men good?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> I quite agree.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And in what respect are we going to have these men
        good, and in what useful? Or shall we venture to say they are to make
        others so, and these again others? In what respect they can possibly be
        good is nowhere evident to us,
      </p>

      <p>
        since we have discredited all the business commonly called politics, and
        it is merely a case of the proverbial “Corinthus Divine” ; and, as I was
        saying, we are equally or even worse at fault as to what that knowledge
        can be which is to make us happy.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Upon my word, Socrates, you got yourselves there, it
        seems, into a pretty fix.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> So then I myself, Crito, finding
      </p>

      <p>
        I had fallen into this perplexity, began to exclaim at the top of my
        voice, beseeching the two strangers as though I were calling upon the
        Heavenly Twins to save us, the lad and myself, from the mighty wave of
        the argument, and to give us the best of their efforts, and this done,
        to make plain to us what that knowledge can be of which we must get hold
        if we are to spend the remainder of our lives in a proper way
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Well, did Euthydemus consent to propound anything for you?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Why, certainly; and he began his discourse, my good
        friend, in this very lofty-minded fashion:
      </p>

      <p>
        Would you rather, Socrates, that I instructed you as to this knowledge
        which has baffled you all this while, or propound that you have it?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        0 gifted sir, I exclaimed, and have you the power to do this?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly I have, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then for Heaven's sake, I cried, propound that I have it! This will be
        much easier than learning foraman of my age.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Come then, answer me this, he said: Do you know anything?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, indeed, I replied. and many things, though trifles.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That is enough, he said; now do you think it possible that anything that
        is should not be just that which it actually is?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        On my soul, not I.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now you, he said, know something?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then you are knowing, if you really know?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, in just that something.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That makes no difference; you are not under a necessity of knowing
        everything, if you are knowing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, to be sure, I replied; for there are many other things which I do
        not know.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then if you do not know something, you are not knowing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not in that thing, my dear sir, I replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Are you therefore any the less unknowing? Just now you said you were
        knowing;
      </p>

      <p>
        so here you are, actually the very man that you are, and again, not that
        man, in regard to the same matter and at the same time!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Admitted, Euthydemus, I said: as the saying goes, “well said whate'er
        you say.” How therefore do I know that knowledge which we were seeking?
        Since forsooth it is impossible for the same thing to be so and not be
        so; by knowing one thing I know all;—for I could not be at once both
        knowing and unknowing;—and as I know everything I have that knowledge to
        boot: is that your line of argument? Is this your wisdom?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, you see, Socrates, he said, your own words refute you.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, but, Euthydemus, I continued, are you not in the same plight? I
        assure you, so long as I had you and this dear fellow Dionysodorus to
        share my lot, however hard, I should have nothing to complain of. Tell
        me, you both know some existent things, of course, and others you do
        not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means, Socrates, said Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How do you mean? I asked: do you then not know anything?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Oh yes, we do, he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        So you know everything, I asked, since you know anything?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Everything, he replied; yes, and you too, if you know one thing, know
        all.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Good Heavens, I cried, what a wonderful statement! What a great blessing
        to boast of! And the rest of mankind, do they know everything or
        nothing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Surely, he said, they cannot know some things and not others, and so be
        at once knowing and unknowing.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But what then? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        All men, he replied, know all things, if they know one.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In the name of goodness,
      </p>

      <p>
        Dionysodorus, I said—for now I can see both of you are serious; before,
        I could hardly prevail on you to be so—do you yourselves really know
        everything? Carpentry, for instance, and shoe-making?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you are good hands at leather-stitching?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why yes, in faith, and cobbling, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And are you good also at such things as counting the stars, and the
        sand?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said: can you think we would not admit that also?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here Ctesippus broke in: Be so good,
      </p>

      <p>
        Dionysodorus, he said, as to place some such evidence before me as will
        convince me that what you say is true.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What shall I put forward? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do you know how many teeth Euthydemus has, and does Euthydemus know how
        many you have?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Are you not content, he rejoined, to be told that we know everything?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, do not say that, he replied: only tell us this one thing more, and
        propound to us that you speak the truth. Then, if you tell us how many
        teeth each of you has, and you are found by our counting to have known
        it, we shall believe you thenceforth in everything else likewise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, as they supposed we were making fun of them, they would not do it:
        only they agreed that they knew all subjects, when questioned on them,
        one after the other, by Ctesippus; who, before he had done with them,
        asked them if they knew every kind of thing, even the most unseemly,
        without the least reserve; while they most valiantly encountered his
        questions, agreeing that they had the knowledge in each case, like boars
        when driven up to face the spears: so that I for my part, Crito, became
        quite incredulous,and had to ask in the end if Dionysodorus knew
      </p>

      <p>
        also how to dance. To which he replied: Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do not suppose, I said, that you have attained such a degree of skill
        as to do sword-dancing, or be whirled about on a wheel, at your time of
        life?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There is nothing, he said, that I cannot do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then tell me, I went on, do you know everything at present only, or for
        ever?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        For ever too, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And when you were children, and were just born, you knew?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Everything, they both replied together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, to us the thing seemed incredible: then Euthydemus said: You do not
        believe it, Socrates?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I will only say, I replied, that you must indeed be clever.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, he said, if you will consent to answer me, I will propound that you
        too admit these surprising facts.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Oh, I am only too glad, I replied, to be refuted in the matter. For if I
        am not aware of my own cleverness, and you are going to show me that I
        know everything always, what greater stroke of luck than this could
        befall me in all my living days?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then answer me, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Ask: I am ready to answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well then, Socrates, he asked, have you knowledge of something, or not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I have.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And tell me, do you know with that whereby you have knowledge, or with
        something else?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        With that whereby I have knowledge: I think you mean the soul, or is not
        that your meaning?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Are you not ashamed, Socrates, he said, to ask a question on your side
        when you are being questioned?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Very well, I said: but how am I to proceed? I will do just as you bid
        me. When I cannot tell what you are asking, is it your order that I
        answer all the same, without asking a question upon it?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, he replied, you surely conceive
      </p>

      <p>
        some meaning in what I say?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do, I replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Answer then to the meaning you conceive to be in my words.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I said, if you ask a question with a different meaning in your
        mind from that which I conceive, and I answer to the latter, are you
        content I should answer nothing to the point?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        For my part, he replied, I shall be content: you, however, will not, so
        far as I can see.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then I declare I shall not answer, I said, before I get it right.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You refuse to answer, he said, to the meaning you conceive in each case,
      </p>

      <p>
        because you will go on driveling, you hopeless old dotard!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here I perceived he was annoyed with me for distinguishing between the
        phrases used, when he wanted to entrap me in his verbal snares. So I
        remembered Connus, how he too is annoyed with me whenever I do not give
        in to him, with the result that he now takes less trouble over me as
        being a stupid person. So being minded to take lessons from this new
        teacher, I decided that I had better give in, lest he should take me for
        a blockhead and not admit me to his classes. So I said: Well, if you
        think fit, Euthydemus,
      </p>

      <p>
        to proceed thus, we must do so; in any case I suppose you understand
        debating better than I do—you are versed in the method, and I am but a
        layman. Begin your questions, then, over again.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now, answer me once more, he said: do you know what you know by means of
        something, or not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I do, I replied; by means of my soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        There he is again, he said, answering more than he is asked. For I am
        not asking what the means is, but only whether you know by some means.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I did again answer more than I ought, I said, through lack of
        education. But forgive me, and I will now simply reply that I know what
        I know by some means.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By one and the same means always, he asked, or sometimes by one and
        sometimes by another?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Always, whenever I know, I replied, it is by this means.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There again, he cried, you really must stop adding these qualifications.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I am so afraid this word “always” may bring us to grief.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not us, he rejoined, but, if anyone, you. Now answer: do you know by
        this means always?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Always, I, replied, since I must withdraw the “whenever.”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then you always know by this means: that being the case, do you know
        some things by this means of knowing, and some things by another means,
        or everything by this?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Everything by this, I replied; everything, that is, that I know.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There it comes again, he cried; the same qualification!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I withdraw my “that is, that I know.”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, do not withdraw a single word, he said: I ask you for no concession.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only answer me: could you know all things if you did not know
        everything?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It would be most surprising, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then he went on: You may therefore add on now whatever you please: for
        you admit that you know all things.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It seems I do, I replied, seeing that my “that I know” has no force, and
        I know everything.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now you have also admitted that you know always by the means whereby you
        know, whenever you know—or however you like to put it. For you have
        admitted that you always know and, at the same time, everything. Hence
        it is clear that
      </p>

      <p>
        even as a child you knew, both when you were being born and when you
        were being conceived: and before you yourself came into being or heaven
        and earth existed, you knew all things, since you always know. Yes, and
        I declare, he said, you yourself will always know all things, if it be
        my pleasure.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Oh, pray let it be your pleasure, I replied, most worshipful Euthydemus,
        if what you say is really true. Only I do not quite trust in your
        efficacy, if your pleasure is not to he also that of your brother here,
        Dionysodorus: if it is, you will probably prevail. And tell me, I went
        on,
      </p>

      <p>
        since I cannot hope in a general way to dispute the statement that I
        know everything with persons so prodigiously clever—since it is your
        statement—how am I to say I know certain things, Euthydemus; for
        instance, that good men are unjust? Come, tell me, do I know this or
        not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You know it certainly, he said. What? I said. That the good are not
        unjust.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite so, I said: I knew that all the time; but that is not what I ask:
      </p>

      <p>
        tell me, where did I learn that the good are unjust?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nowhere, said Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then I do not know this, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You are spoiling the argument, said Euthydemus to Dionysodorus, and we
        shall find that this fellow does not know, and is at once both knowing
        and unknowing.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this Dionysodorus reddened. But you, I said, what do you mean,
        Euthydemus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you find that your brother, who knows everything, has not spoken
        aright?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I a brother of Euthydemus? quickly interposed Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Whereupon I said: Let me alone, good sir, till Euthydemus has taught me
        that I know that good men are unjust, and do not grudge me this lesson.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You are running away, Socrates, said Dionysodorus; you refuse to answer.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, and with good reason, I said: for I am weaker than
      </p>

      <p>
        either one of you, so I have no scruple about running away from the two
        together. You see, I am sadly inferior to Hercules, who was no match for
        the hydra—that she-professor who was so clever that she sent forth many
        heads of debate in place of each one that was cut off; nor for another
        sort of, crab-professor from the sea— freshly, I fancy, arrived on
        shore; and, when the hero was so bothered with its leftward barks and
        bites, he summoned his nephew Iolaus to the rescue,
      </p>

      <p>
        and he brought him effective relief. But if my Iolaus were to come, he
        would do more harm than good.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, answer this, said Dionysodorus, now you have done your descanting:
        Was Iolaus more Hercules' nephew than yours?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I see I had best answer you, Dionysodorus, I said. For you will never
        cease putting questions—I think I may say I am sure of this—in a
        grudging, obstructing spirit, so that Euthydemus may not teach me that
        bit of cleverness.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then answer, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I answer, I said, that Iolaus was Hercules' nephew, but not mine,
      </p>

      <p>
        so far as I can see, in any way whatever. For Patrocles, my brother, was
        not his father; only Hercules' brother Iphicles had a name somewhat
        similar to his.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And Patrocles, he said, is your brother?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, I said: that is, by the same mother, but not by the same
        father.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then he is your brother and not your brother.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not by the same father, worthy sir, I replied. His father was
        Chaeredemus, mine Sophroniscus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So Sophroniscus and Chaeredemus, he said, were “father”?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, I said: the former mine,
      </p>

      <p>
        the latter his. Then surely, he went on, Chaeredemus was other than
        “father”?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Than mine, at any rate, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why then, he was father while being other than father. Or are you the
        same as “the stone”?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I fear you may prove that of me, I said, though I do not feel like it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then are you other than the stone?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Other, I must say.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then of course, he went on, if you are other than stone, you are not
        stone? And if you are other than gold, you are not gold?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Hence Chaeredemus, he said, being other than father,
      </p>

      <p>
        cannot be “father.”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It seems, I said, that he is not a father.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, for I presume, interposed Euthydemus, that if Chaeredemus is a
        father Sophroniscus in his turn, being other than a father, is not a
        father; so that you, Socrates, are fatherless.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here Ctesippus took it up, observing: And your father too, is he not in
        just the same plight? Is he other than my father?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not in the slightest, said Euthydemus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What, asked the other, is he the same?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        The same, to be sure.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I should not like to think he was: but tell
        me, Euthydemus,
      </p>

      <p>
        is he my father only, or everybody else's too?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Everybody else's too, he replied; or do you suppose that the same man,
        being a father, can be no father?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I did suppose so, said Ctesippus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, said the other, and that a thing being gold could be not gold? Or
        being a man, not man?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Perhaps, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus, you are knotting flax with cotton,
        as they say: for it is a strange result that you state, if your father
        is father of all.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He is, though, was the reply.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Of all men, do you mean? asked Ctesippus, or of horses too,
      </p>

      <p>
        and all other animals?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Of all, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And is your mother a mother in the same way?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        My mother too.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And is your mother a mother of sea-urchins?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, and yours is also, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So then you are a brother of the gudgeons and whelps and porkers.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, and so are you, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then your father is a boar and a dog.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And so is yours, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, said Dionysodorus, and it will take you but a moment, if you will
        answer me, Ctesippus, to acknowledge all this. Just tell me, have you a
        dog?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, a real rogue, said Ctesippus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Has he got puppies?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, a set of rogues like him.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then is the dog their father?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, indeed; I saw him with my own eyes covering the bitch.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, is not the dog yours?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Thus he is a father, and yours, and accordingly the dog turns out to be
        your father, and you a brother of whelps.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Hereupon Dionysodorus struck in again quickly, lest Ctesippus should get
        a word in before him: Answer me just one more little point: do you beat
        this dog?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Ctesippus laughed and said: My word, yes; since I cannot beat you!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So you beat your own father?
      </p>

      <p>
        he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There would be much more justice, though, he replied, in my beating
        yours, for being so ill-advised as to beget clever sons like you. Yet I
        doubt, Ctesippus went on, if your father, Euthydemus—the puppies'
        father—has derived much good from this wisdom of yours.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, he has no need of much good, Ctesippus, neither he nor you.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And have you no need either, yourself, Euthydemus? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, nor has any other man. Just tell me, Ctesippus,
      </p>

      <p>
        whether you think it good for a sick man to drink physic when he wants
        it, or whether you consider it not good; or for a man to go to the wars
        with arms rather than without them.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        With them, I think, he replied: and yet I believe you are about to utter
        one of your pleasantries.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You will gather that well enough, he said: only answer me. Since you
        admit that physic is good for a man to drink when necessary, surely one
        ought to drink this good thing as much as possible; and in such a case
        it will be well to pound and infuse in it a cart-load of hellebore?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To this Ctesippus replied: Quite so,
      </p>

      <p>
        to be sure, Euthydemus, at any rate if the drinker is as big as the
        Delphian statue.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then, further, since in war, he proceeded, it is good to have arms, one
        ought to have as many spears and shields as possible, if we agree that
        it is a good thing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I suppose, said Ctesippus and you, Euthydemus, do you take the
        other view, that it should be one shield and one spear?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What, he said, and would you arm Geryon also and Briareus in this way? I
        thought you more of an expert than that, considering you are a
        man-at-arms, and your comrade here too!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this Euthydemus was silent; then Dionysodorus
      </p>

      <p>
        asked some questions on Ctesippus' previous answers, saying: Well now,
        gold is in your opinion a good thing to have?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, and—here I agree—plenty of it too, said Ctesippus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, do you not think it right to have good things always and
        everywhere?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Assuredly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you admit that gold is also a good?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, I have admitted it, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then we ought always to have it, and everywhere, and above all, in
        oneself?
      </p>

      <p>
        And one will be happiest if one has three talents of gold in one's
        belly, a talent in one's skull, and a stater of gold in each eye?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, Euthydemus, replied Ctesippus, they say that among the Scythians
        those are the happiest and best men who have a lot of gold in their own
        skulls—somewhat as you were saying a moment ago that “dog” is “father”;
        and a still more marvellous thing is told, how they drink out of their
        skulls when gilded, and gaze inside them, holding their own headpiece in
        their hands.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Tell me, said Euthydemus,
      </p>

      <p>
        do the Scythians and men in general see things possible of sight, or
        things impossible?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Possible, I presume.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you do so too?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I too.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then you see our cloaks?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And have they power of sight?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite extraordinarily, said Ctesippus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What do they see? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nothing. Perhaps you do not think they see—you are such a sweet
        innocent. I should say, Euthydemus, that you have fallen asleep with
        your eyes open and, if it be possible to speak and at the same time say
        nothing,
      </p>

      <p>
        that this is what you are doing.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, asked Dionysodorus, may there not be a speaking of the silent?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means whatever, replied Ctesippus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nor a silence of speaking?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Still less, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now, when you speak of stones and timbers and irons, are you not
        speaking of the silent?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not if I walk by a smithy, for there, as they say, the irons speak and
        cry aloud, when they are touched; so here your wisdom has seduced you
        into nonsense. But come, you have still to propound me your second
        point,
      </p>

      <p>
        how on the other hand there may be a silence of speaking. (It struck me
        that Ctesippus was specially excited on account of his young friend's
        presence.)
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When you are silent, said Euthydemus, are you not making a silence of
        all things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then it is a silence of speaking things also, if the speaking are among
        all things.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What, said Ctesippus, are not all things silent?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I presume not, said Euthydemus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But then, my good sir, do all things speak?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I suppose, at least those that speak.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But that is not what I ask, he said: are all things silent or do they
        speak?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Neither and both,
      </p>

      <p>
        said Dionysodorus, snatching the word from him: I am quite sure that is
        an answer that will baffle you!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this Ctesippus, as his manner was, gave a mighty guffaw, and said:
        Ah, Euthydemus, your brother has made the argument ambiguous with his
        “both,” and is worsted and done for.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Cleinias was greatly delighted and laughed, so that Ctesippus felt
        his strength was as the strength of ten: but I fancy Ctesippus—he is
        such a rogue—had picked up these very words by overhearing the men
        themselves, since in nobody else of the present age is such wisdom to be
        found.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I remarked: Why are you laughing, Cleinias, at such serious and
        beautiful things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What, have you, Socrates, ever yet seen a beautiful thing? asked
        Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I have, I replied, and many of them, Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Did you find them different from the beautiful, he said,
      </p>

      <p>
        or the same as the beautiful?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here I was desperately perplexed, and felt that I had my deserts for the
        grunt I had made: however, I replied that they were different from the
        beautiful itself, though each of them had some beauty present with it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So if an ox is present with you, he said, you are an ox, and since I am
        now present with you, you are Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Heavens, do not say that! I cried.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But in what way can one thing, by having a different thing present with
        it, be itself different?
      </p>

      <p>
        Are you at a loss there? I asked: already I was attempting to imitate
        the cleverness of these men, I was so eager to get it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Can I help being at a loss, he said, I and likewise everybody else in
        the world, in face of what cannot be?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What is that you say, Dionysodorus? I asked: is not the beautiful
        beautiful, and the ugly ugly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, if it seems so to me, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then does it seem so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then the same also is the same, and the different different? For I
        presume the different cannot be the same; nay, I thought
      </p>

      <p>
        not even a child would doubt that the different is different. But,
        Dionysodorus, you have deliberately passed over this one point; though,
        on the whole, I feel that, like craftsmen finishing off each his special
        piece of work, you two are carrying out your disputation in excellent
        style.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, he asked, do you know what is each craftsman's special piece of
        work? First of all, whose proper task is it to forge brass? Can you
        tell?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I can: a brazier's.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, again, whose to make pots?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        A potter's.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Once more, whose to slaughter and skin,
      </p>

      <p>
        and after cutting up the joints to stew and roast?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        A caterer's, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now, if one does one's proper work, he said, one will do rightly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, to be sure.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And is it, as you say, the caterer's proper work to cut up and skin? Did
        you admit this or not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I did so, I replied, but pray forgive me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It is clear then, he proceeded, that if someone slaughters the caterer
        and cuts him up, and then stews or roasts him, he will be doing his
        proper work; and if he hammers the brazier himself, and moulds the
        potter, he will be doing his business likewise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poseidon! I exclaimed, there you give the finishing touch to your
        wisdom. I wonder if this skill could ever come to me in such manner as
        to be my very own.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Would you recognize it, Socrates, he asked, if it came to be your own?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, if only you are agreeable, I replied, without a doubt.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, he went on, do you imagine you perceive what is yours?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, if I take your meaning aright: for all my hopes arise from you, and
        end In Euthydemus here.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then tell me, he asked, do you count those things yours which you
        control and are free to use as you please?
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, an ox or a sheep,would you count these as yours, if you
        were free to sell or bestow them, or sacrifice them to any god you
        chose? And things which you could not treat thus are not yours?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Hereupon, since I knew that some brilliant result was sure to bob up
        from the mere turn of the questions, and as I also wanted to hear it as
        quickly as possible, I said: It is precisely as you say; only such
        things are mine.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, he went on: you call those things animals which have life?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you admit that only those animals are yours which you are at liberty
        to deal with in those various ways that I mentioned just now?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I admit that.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then—after a very ironical pause, as though he were pondering some great
        matter—he proceeded: Tell me, Socrates, have you an ancestral Zeus ?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here I suspected the discussion was approaching the point at which it
        eventually ended, and so I tried what desperate wriggle I could to
        escape from the net in which I now felt myself entangled. My answer was:
        I have not, Dionysodorus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What a miserable fellow you must be,
      </p>

      <p>
        he said, and no Athenian at all, if you have neither ancestral gods, nor
        shrines, nor anything else that denotes a gentleman!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Enough, Dionysodorus; speak fair words, and don't browbeat your pupil!
        For I have altars and shrines, domestic and ancestral, and everything
        else of the sort that other Athenians have.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then have not other Athenians, he asked, their ancestral Zeus?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        None of the Ionians, I replied, give him this title, neither we nor
        those who have left this city to settle abroad: they have an ancestral
        Apollo,
      </p>

      <p>
        because of Ion's parentage. Among us the name “ancestral” is not given
        to Zeus, but that of “houseward” and “tribal,” and we have a tribal
        Athena.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That will do, said Dionysodorus; you have, it seems, Apollo and Zeus and
        Athena.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then these must be your gods? he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        My ancestors, I said, and lords.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, at least, you have them, he said: or have you not admitted they
        are yours?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I have admitted it, I replied: what else could I do?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And are not these gods animals? he asked: you know you have admitted
      </p>

      <p>
        that whatever has life is an animal. Or have these gods no life?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They have, I replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then are they not animals?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, animals, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And those animals, he went on, you have admitted to be yours, which you
        are free to bestow and sell and sacrifice to any god you please.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I have admitted it, I replied; there is no escape for me, Euthydemus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Come then, tell me straight off, he said; since you admit that Zeus and
        the other gods are yours, are you free to sell or
      </p>

      <p>
        bestow them or treat them just as you please, like the other animals?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, Crito, here I must say I was knocked out, as it were, by the
        argument, and lay speechless; then Ctesippus rushed to the rescue
        and—Bravo, Hercules! he cried, a fine argument!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Whereat Dionysodorus asked: Now, do you mean that Hercules is a bravo,
        or that bravo is Hercules?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Ctesippus replied: Poseidon, what a frightful use of words! I give up
        the fight: these two are invincible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hereupon I confess, my dear Crito, that everyone present without
        exception wildly applauded the argument and the two men, till they all
        nearly died of laughing and clapping and rejoicing. For their previous
        successes had been highly acclaimed one by one, but only by the devotees
        of Euthydemus; whereas now almost the very pillars of the Lyceum took
        part in the joyful acclamations in honor of the pair. For myself, I was
        quite disposed to admit that never had I set eyes
      </p>

      <p>
        on such clever people, and I was so utterly enthralled by their skill
        that I betook myself to praising and congratulating them, and said: Ah,
        happy pair! What amazing genius, to acquire such a great accomplishment
        so quickly and in so short a time! Among the many fine points in your
        arguments, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, there is one that stands out in
        particular magnificence—that you care not a jot for the multitude, or
        for any would-be important or famous people, but only for those of your
        own sort. And I am perfectly sure that there are but a few persons
      </p>

      <p>
        like yourselves who would be satisfied with these arguments: the rest of
        the world regard them only as arguments with which, I assure you, they
        would feel it a greater disgrace to refute others than to be refuted
        themselves. And further, there is at the same time a popular and kindly
        feature in your talk: when you say there is nothing either beautiful, or
        good, or white, and so on, and no difference of things at all, in truth
        you simply stitch up men's mouths,
      </p>

      <p>
        as you expressly say you do; while as to your apparent power of
        stitching up your own mouths as well, this is a piece of agreeable
        manners that takes off any offence from your talk. But the greatest
        thing of all is, that this faculty of yours is such, and is so skilfully
        contrived, that anyone in the world may learn it of you in a very short
        time; this fact I perceived myself by watching Ctesippus and observing
        how quickly he was able to imitate you on the spot. Now, in so far as
        your accomplishment can be quickly imparted,
      </p>

      <p>
        it is excellent; but for public discussions it is not suitable: if I may
        advise you, beware of talking before a number of people, lest they learn
        the whole thing in a trice and give you no credit for it. The best thing
        for you is to talk to each other by yourselves, in private; failing
        that, if a third person is present, it must be someone who will pay you
        a good fee. And if you are prudent
      </p>

      <p>
        you will give this same counsel to your pupils also—that they are never
        to converse with anybody except you and each other. For it is the rare,
        Euthydemus, that is precious, while water is cheapest, though best, as
        Pindar said. But come, I said, see if you can admit both me and Cleinias
        here to your class.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        This, Crito, was our conversation, and after exchanging a few more words
        we went off. Now you must arrange to join us in taking lessons from the
        pair;
      </p>

      <p>
        for they say they are able to teach anyone who is willing to pay good
        money, and that no sort of character or age—and it is well that you
        especially should be told that they promise that their art is no
        hindrance to money-making—need deter anyone from an easy acquisition of
        their wisdom.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Indeed, Socrates, I love listening, and would be glad to
        learn from them; but I am afraid I am one of the sort who are not like
        Euthydemus, but who, as you described them just now, would prefer being
        refuted
      </p>

      <p>
        to refuting with such arguments. Now, although I feel it is absurd to
        admonish you, I wish nevertheless to report to you what was told me just
        now. Do you know, one of the people who had left your discussion came up
        to me as I was taking a stroll—a man who thinks himself very wise, one
        of those who are so clever at turning out speeches for the law-courts
        —and said: Crito, do you take no lessons from these wise men? No, in
        truth, I replied: there was such a crowd that, though I stood quite
        close, I was unable to catch what was said. Well, let me tell you, he
        said, it was something worth hearing.
      </p>

      <p>
        What was it? I asked. You would have heard the disputation of men who
        are the most accomplished of our day in that kind of speaking. To this I
        replied: Well, what did they show forth to you? Merely the sort of
        stuff, he said, that you may hear such people babbling about at any
        time—making an inconsequent ado about matters of no consequence (in some
        such parlance he expressed himself). Whereupon—Well, all the same, I
        said, philosophy is a charming thing. Charming is it, my dear innocent?
        he exclaimed:
      </p>

      <p>
        nay, a thing of no consequence. Why, had you been in that company just
        now, you would have been filled with shame, I fancy, for your particular
        friend: he was so strangely willing to lend himself to persons who care
        not a straw what they say, but merely fasten on any phrase that turns
        up. And these, as I said just now, are the heads of their profession
        today. But the fact is, Crito, he went on, the business itself and the
        people who follow it are worthless and ridiculous. Now, in my opinion,
        Socrates, lie was not right in decrying the pursuit:
      </p>

      <p>
        he is wrong, and so is anyone else who decries it: though I must say I
        felt he was right in blaming the readiness to engage in discussion with
        such people before a large company.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Crito, these people are very odd. But I do not yet know
        what answer I shall give you. Of which party was he who came up to you
        and blamed philosophy? Was he one of those who excel in the contests of
        the courts, an orator; or of those who equip the orators for the fray, a
        composer of the speeches they deliver in their contests?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Crito:</b> Nothing of an orator, I dare swear, nor do I think he has
        ever appeared in court: only he is reputed to know about the business,
        so they declare, and to be a clever person, and compose clever speeches.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Now I understand: it was of these people that I was
        just now going to speak myself. They are the persons, Crito, whom
        Prodicus described as the border-ground between philosopher and
        politician, yet they fancy that they are the wisest of all mankind, and
        that they not merely are but are thought so by a great many people; and
        accordingly
      </p>

      <p>
        they feel that none but the followers of philosophy stand in the way of
        their universal renown. Hence they believe that, if they can reduce the
        latter to a status of no esteem, the prize of victory will by common
        consent be awarded to them, without dispute or delay, and their claim to
        wisdom will be won. For they consider themselves to be in very truth the
        wisest, but find that, when caught in private conversation, they are cut
        off short by Euthydemus and his set. This conceit of their wisdom is
        very natural, since they regard themselves as moderately versed in
        philosophy, and moderately too in politics, on quite reasonable grounds:
      </p>

      <p>
        for they have dipped into both as far as they needed, and, evading all
        risk and struggle, are content to gather the fruits of wisdom.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Well, now, do you consider, Socrates, that there is
        anything in what they say? It is not to be denied that these men have
        some color for their statements.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Yes, that is so, Crito; color rather than truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is no easy matter to persuade them that either people or things,
        which are between two other things and have a certain share of both, if
        compounded of bad and good are found to be better than the one and worse
        than the other; but if compounded of two good things which have not the
        same object, they are worse than either of their components in relation
        to the object to which each of them is adapted; while if they are
        compounded of two bad things which have not the same object, and stand
        between them, this is the only case
      </p>

      <p>
        where they are better than either of the two things of which they have a
        share. Now if philosophy and the statesman's business are both good
        things, and each of them has a different object, and if these persons,
        partaking of both, are between them, their claims are nought; for they
        are inferior to both: if one is good and the other bad, they are better
        than the one and worse than the other: while if both are bad, in this
        case there would be some truth in their statement, but in any other case
        there is none. Now I do not think they will admit
      </p>

      <p>
        either that both these things are bad, or that one is bad and the other
        good: the truth is that these people, partaking of both, are inferior to
        both in respect of the objects for which statesmanship and philosophy
        are important; and while they are really in the third place they seek to
        be accorded the first. However, we ought to be indulgent towards their
        ambition and not feel annoyed, while still judging them to be what they
        actually are. For we should be glad of anyone, whoever he may be, who
        says anything that verges on good sense, and labours steadily
      </p>

      <p>
        and manfully in its pursuit.
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Now I myself, Socrates, as I so often tell you, am in
        doubt about my sons, as to what I am to do with them. The younger is as
        yet quite small; but Critobulus is already grown up, and needs someone
        who will be of service to him. When I am in your company, the effect on
        me is such as to make me feel it is mere madness to have taken ever so
        much pains in various directions for the good of my children—
      </p>

      <p>
        first in so marrying that they should be of very good blood on their
        mother's side; then in making money so that they might be as well off as
        possible; while I have neglected the training of the boys themselves.
        But when I glance at one of the persons who profess to educate people, I
        am dismayed, and feel that each one of them, when I consider them, is
        wholly unsuitable—
      </p>

      <p>
        to tell you the truth between ourselves. So that I cannot see how I am
        to incline the lad towards philosophy.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> My dear Crito are you not aware that in every trade the
        duffers are many and worthless, whereas the good workers are few and
        worth any price? Why, do you not hold athletics, and money-making, and
        rhetoric, and generalship, to be fine things?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Certainly I do, of course.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Well then, in each of these, do you not see most men
        making a ridiculous show at their respective tasks?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> Yes, I know: what you say is perfectly true.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then will you yourself on this account eschew all these
        pursuits, and not let your son have anything to do with them?
        <br />
        <b>Crito:</b> No, there would be no good reason for that, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then avoid at least what is wrong, Crito: let those who
        practise philosophy have their way,
      </p>

      <p>
        whether they are helpful or mischievous; and when you have tested the
        matter itself, well and truly, if you find it to be a poor affair, turn
        everyone you can away from it, not only your sons: but if you find it to
        be such as I think it is, pursue and ply it without fear, both you, as
        they say, and yours.
