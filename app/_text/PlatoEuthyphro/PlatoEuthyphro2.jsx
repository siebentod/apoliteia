        <i>Euthyphro, Socrates</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> What strange thing has happened, Socrates, that you
        have left your accustomed haunts in the Lyceum and are now haunting the
        portico where the king archon sits? For it cannot be that you have an
        action before the king, as I have.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Our Athenians, Euthyphro, do not call it an action, but
        an indictment.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> What? Somebody has, it seems, brought an indictment
        against you;
      </p>

      <p>
        for I don't accuse you of having brought one against anyone else.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Certainly not.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> But someone else against you?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Quite so.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Who is he?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> I don't know the man very well myself, Euthyphro, for
        he seems to be a young and unknown person. His name, however, is
        Meletus, I believe. And he is of the deme of Pitthus, if you remember
        any Pitthian Meletus, with long hair and only a little beard, but with a
        hooked nose.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I don't remember him, Socrates. But
      </p>

      <p>
        what sort of an indictment has he brought against you?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> What sort? No mean one, it seems to me; for the fact
        that, young as he is, he has apprehended so important a matter reflects
        no small credit upon him. For he says he knows how the youth are
        corrupted and who those are who corrupt them. He must be a wise man;
        who, seeing my lack of wisdom and that I am corrupting his fellows,
        comes to the State, as a boy runs to his mother, to accuse me. And he
        seems to me to be the only one of the public men who begins in the right
        way; for the right way
      </p>

      <p>
        is to take care of the young men first, to make them as good as
        possible, just as a good husbandman will naturally take care of the
        young plants first and afterwards of the rest. And so Meletus, perhaps,
        is first
      </p>

      <p>
        clearing away us who corrupt the young plants, as he says; then after
        this, when he has turned his attention to the older men, he will bring
        countless most precious blessings upon the State,—at least, that is the
        natural outcome of the beginning he has made.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I hope it may be so, Socrates; but I fear the opposite
        may result. For it seems to me that he begins by injuring the State at
        its very heart, when he undertakes to harm you. Now tell me, what does
        he say you do that corrupts the young?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Absurd things, my friend, at first hearing. For he says
        I am a maker of gods; and because I make new gods and do not believe in
        the old ones, he indicted me for the sake of these old ones, as he says.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I understand, Socrates; it is because you say the
        divine monitor keeps coming to you. So he has brought the indictment
        against you for making innovations in religion, and he is going into
        court to slander you, knowing that slanders on such subjects are readily
        accepted by the people. Why, they even laugh at me and say I am crazy
      </p>

      <p>
        when I say anything in the assembly about divine things and foretell the
        future to them. And yet there is not one of the things I have foretold
        that is not true; but they are jealous of all such men as you and I are.
        However, we must not be disturbed, but must come to close quarters with
        them.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> My dear Euthyphro, their ridicule is perhaps of no
        consequence. For the Athenians, I fancy, are not much concerned, if they
        think a man is clever, provided he does not impart his clever notions to
        others; but when they think he makes others to be like himself,
      </p>

      <p>
        they are angry with him, either through jealousy, as you say, or for
        some other reason.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I don't much desire to test their sentiments toward me
        in this matter.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> No, for perhaps they think that you are reserved and
        unwilling to impart your wisdom. But I fear that because of my love of
        men they think that I not only pour myself out copiously to anyone and
        everyone without payment, but that I would even pay something myself, if
        anyone would listen to me. Now if, as I was saying just now, they were
        to laugh at me, as you say they do at you, it would not be at all
        unpleasant
      </p>

      <p>
        to pass the time in the court with jests and laughter; but if they are
        in earnest, then only soothsayers like you can tell how this will end.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Well, Socrates, perhaps it won't amount to much, and
        you will bring your case to a satisfactory ending, as I think I shall
        mine.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> What is your case, Euthyphro? Are you defending or
        prosecuting?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Prosecuting.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Whom?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Such a man that they think I am insane because I am
        prosecuting him.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Why? Are you prosecuting one who has wings to fly away
        with?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> No flying for him at his ripe old age.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Who is he?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> My father.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Your father, my dear man?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But what is the charge, and what is the suit about?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Murder, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Heracles! Surely, Euthyphro, most people do not know
        where the right lies; for I fancy it is not everyone who can rightly do
        what you are doing,
      </p>

      <p>
        but only one who is already very far advanced in wisdom.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Very far, indeed, Socrates, by Zeus.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Is the one who was killed by your father a relative?
        But of course he was; for you would not bring a charge of murder against
        him on a stranger's account.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> It is ridiculous, Socrates, that you think it matters
        whether the man who was killed was a stranger or a relative, and do not
        see that the only thing to consider is whether the action of the slayer
        was justified or not, and that if it was justified one ought to let him
        alone, and if not, one ought to proceed against him, even if he share
        one's hearth
      </p>

      <p>
        and eat at one's table. For the pollution is the same if you associate
        knowingly with such a man and do not purify yourself and him by
        proceeding against him. In this case, the man who was killed was a hired
        workman of mine, and when we were farming at Naxos, he was working there
        on our land. Now he got drunk, got angry with one of our house slaves,
        and butchered him. So my father bound him hand and foot, threw him into
        a ditch, and sent a man here to Athens to ask the religious adviser what
        he ought
      </p>

      <p>
        to do. In the meantime he paid no attention to the man as he lay there
        bound, and neglected him, thinking that he was a murderer and it did not
        matter if he were to die. And that is just what happened to him. For he
        died of hunger and cold and his bonds before the messenger came back
        from the adviser. Now my father and the rest of my relatives are angry
        with me, because for the sake of this murderer I am prosecuting my
        father for murder. For they say he did not kill him, and if he had
        killed him never so much, yet since the dead man was a murderer, I ought
        not to trouble myself about such a fellow,
      </p>

      <p>
        because it is unholy for a son to prosecute his father for murder. Which
        shows how little they know what the divine law is in regard to holiness
        and unholiness.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But, in the name of Zeus, Euthyphro, do you think your
        knowledge about divine laws and holiness and unholiness is so exact
        that, when the facts are as you say, you are not afraid of doing
        something unholy yourself in prosecuting your father for murder?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I should be of no use, Socrates,
      </p>

      <p>
        and Euthyphro would be in no way different from other men, if I did not
        have exact knowledge about all such things.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then the best thing for me, my admirable Euthyphro, is
        to become your pupil and, before the suit with Meletus comes on, to
        challenge him and say that I always thought it very important before to
        know about divine matters and that now, since he says I am doing wrong
        by acting carelessly and making innovations in matters of religion, I
        have become your pupil. And “Meletus,” I should say,
      </p>

      <p>
        “if you acknowledge that Euthyphro is wise in such matters, then believe
        that I also hold correct opinions, and do not bring me to trial; and if
        you do not acknowledge that, then bring a suit against him, my teacher,
        rather than against me, and charge him with corrupting the old, namely,
        his father and me, which he does by teaching me and by correcting and
        punishing his father.” And if he does not do as I ask and does not
        release me from the indictment or bring it against you in my stead, I
        could say in the court the same things I said in my challenge to him,
        could I not?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> By Zeus, Socrates, if he should undertake to indict
        me,
      </p>

      <p>
        I fancy I should find his weak spot, and it would be much more a
        question about him in court than about me.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And I, my dear friend, perceiving this, wish to become
        your pupil; for I know that neither this fellow Meletus, nor anyone
        else, seems to notice you at all, but he has seen through me so sharply
        and so easily that he has indicted me for impiety. Now in the name of
        Zeus, tell me what you just now asserted that you knew so well. What do
        you say is the nature of piety and impiety, both
      </p>

      <p>
        in relation to murder and to other things? Is not holiness always the
        same with itself in every action and, on the other hand, is not
        unholiness the opposite of all holiness, always the same with itself and
        whatever is to be unholy possessing some one characteristic quality?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Tell me then, what do you say holiness is, and what
        unholiness?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Well then, I say that holiness is doing what I am
        doing now, prosecuting the wrongdoer who commits murder or steals from
        the temples or does any such thing, whether he be your father,
      </p>

      <p>
        or your mother or anyone else, and not prosecuting him is unholy. And,
        Socrates, see what a sure proof I offer you,—a proof I have already
        given to others,—that this is established and right and that we ought
        not to let him who acts impiously go unpunished, no matter who he may
        be. Men believe
      </p>

      <p>
        that Zeus is the best and most just of the gods, and they acknowledge
        that he put his father in bonds because he wickedly devoured his
        children, and he in turn had mutilated his father for similar reasons;
        but they are incensed against me because I proceed against my father
        when he has done wrong, and so they are inconsistent in what they say
        about the gods and about me.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Is not this, Euthyphro, the reason why I am being
        prosecuted, because when people tell such stories about the gods I find
        it hard to accept them? And therefore, probably, people will say I am
        wrong. Now if you, who know so much about such things,
      </p>

      <p>
        accept these tales, I suppose I too must give way. For what am I to say,
        who confess frankly that I know nothing about them? But tell me, in the
        name of Zeus, the god of friendship, do you really believe these things
        happened?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, and still more wonderful things than these,
        Socrates, which most people do not know.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And so you believe that there was really war between
        the gods, and fearful enmities and battles and other things of the sort,
        such as are told of by the poets and represented in varied designs
      </p>

      <p>
        by the great artists in our sacred places and especially on the robe
        which is carried up to the Acropolis at the great Panathenaea? for this
        is covered with such representations. Shall we agree that these things
        are true, Euthyphro?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Not only these things, Socrates; but, as I said just
        now, I will, if you like, tell you many other things about the gods,
        which I am sure will amaze you when you hear them.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> I dare say. But you can tell me those things at your
        leisure some other time. At present try to tell more clearly what I
        asked you just now.
      </p>

      <p>
        For, my friend, you did not give me sufficient information before, when
        I asked what holiness was, but you told me that this was holy which you
        are now doing, prosecuting your father for murder.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Well, what I said was true, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Perhaps. But, Euthyphro, you say that many other things
        are holy, do you not?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Why, so they are.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Now call to mind that this is not what I asked you, to
        tell me one or two of the many holy acts, but to tell the essential
        aspect, by which all holy acts are holy; for you said
      </p>

      <p>
        that all unholy acts were unholy and all holy ones holy by one aspect.
        Or don't you remember?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I remember.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Tell me then what this aspect is, that I may keep my
        eye fixed upon it and employ it as a model and, if anything you or
        anyone else does agrees with it, may say that the act is holy, and if
        not, that it is unholy.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> If you wish me to explain in that way, I will do so.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> I do wish it.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Well then, what is dear to the gods is holy,
      </p>

      <p>
        and what is not dear to them is unholy.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Excellent, Euthyphro, now you have answered as I asked
        you to answer. However, whether it is true, I am not yet sure; but you
        will, of course, show that what you say is true.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Come then, let us examine our words. The thing and the
        person that are dear to the gods are holy, and the thing and the person
        that are hateful to the gods are unholy; and the two are not the same,
        but the holy and the unholy are the exact opposites of each other. Is
        not this what we have said?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, just this.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And it seems to be correct?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I think so, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Well then, have we said this also, that the gods,
        Euthyphro, quarrel and disagree with each other, and that there is
        enmity between them?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, we have said that.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But what things is the disagreement about, which causes
        enmity and anger? Let us look at it in this way. If you and I were to
        disagree about number, for instance, which of two numbers were the
        greater, would the disagreement about these matters make us enemies and
        make us angry with each other, or should we not quickly settle it by
        resorting
      </p>

      <p>
        to arithmetic?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Of course we should.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then, too, if we were to disagree about the relative
        size of things, we should quickly put an end to the disagreement by
        measuring?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And we should, I suppose, come to terms about relative
        weights by weighing?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Of course.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But about what would a disagreement be, which we could
        not settle and which would cause us to be enemies and be angry with each
        other? Perhaps you cannot give an answer offhand;
      </p>

      <p>
        but let me suggest it. Is it not about right and wrong, and noble and
        disgraceful, and good and bad? Are not these the questions about which
        you and I and other people become enemies, when we do become enemies,
        because we differ about them and cannot reach any satisfactory
        agreement?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, Socrates, these are the questions about which we
        should become enemies.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And how about the gods,
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> If they disagree, would they not disagree about these
        questions?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Necessarily.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then, my noble Euthyphro, according to what you say,
        some of the gods too think some things are right or wrong and noble or
        disgraceful, and good or bad, and others disagree; for they would not
        quarrel with each other if they did not disagree about these matters. Is
        that the case?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> You are right.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then the gods in each group love the things which they
        consider good and right and hate the opposites of these things?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But you say that the same things are considered right
        by some of them and wrong by others; and it is because they disagree
        about these things
      </p>

      <p>
        that they quarrel and wage war with each other. Is not this what you
        said?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> It is.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then, as it seems, the same things are hated and loved
        by the gods, and the same things would be dear and hateful to the gods.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> So it seems.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And then the same things would be both holy and unholy,
        Euthyphro, according to this statement.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I suppose so.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then you did not answer my question, my friend. For I
        did not ask you what is at once holy and unholy; but, judging from your
        reply, what is dear to the gods is also hateful to the gods. And so,
        Euthyphro,

      <p>
        it would not be surprising if, in punishing your father as you are
        doing, you were performing an act that is pleasing to Zeus, but hateful
        to Cronus and Uranus, and pleasing to Hephaestus, but hateful to Hera,
        and so forth in respect to the other gods, if any disagree with any
        other about it.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> But I think, Socrates, that none of the gods disagrees
        with any other about this, or holds that he who kills anyone wrongfully
        ought not to pay the penalty.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Well, Euthyphro, to return to men, did you ever hear
        anybody arguing that he who had killed anyone wrongfully,
      </p>

      <p>
        or had done anything else whatever wrongfully, ought not to pay the
        penalty?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Why, they are always arguing these points, especially
        in the law courts. For they do very many wrong things; and then there is
        nothing they will not do or say, in defending themselves, to avoid the
        penalty.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Yes, but do they acknowledge, Euthyphro, that they have
        done wrong and, although they acknowledge it, nevertheless say that they
        ought not to pay the penalty?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Oh, no, they don't do that.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then there is something they do not do and say. For
        they do not, I fancy, dare to say and argue that,
      </p>

      <p>
        if they have really done wrong, they ought not to pay the penalty; but,
        I think, they say they have not done wrong; do they not?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> You are right.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then they do not argue this point, that the wrongdoer
        must not pay the penalty; but perhaps they argue about this, who is a
        wrongdoer, and what he did, and when.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> That is true.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then is not the same thing true of the gods, if they
        quarrel about right and wrong, as you say, and some say others have done
        wrong, and some say they have not? For surely, my friend, no one, either
        of gods or men,
      </p>

      <p>
        has the face to say that he who does wrong ought not to pay the penalty.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, you are right about this, Socrates, in the main.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But I think, Euthyphro, those who dispute, both men and
        gods, if the gods do dispute, dispute about each separate act. When they
        differ with one another about any act, some say it was right and others
        that it was wrong. Is it not so?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Come now, my dear Euthyphro,
      </p>

      <p>
        inform me, that I may be made wiser, what proof you have that all the
        gods think that the man lost his life wrongfully, who, when he was a
        servant, committed murder, was bound by the master of the man he killed,
        and died as a result of his bonds before the master who had bound him
        found out from the advisers what he ought to do with him, and that it is
        right on account of such a man for a son to proceed against his father
        and accuse him of murder. Come, try to show me clearly about this, that
      </p>

      <p>
        the gods surely believe that this conduct is right; and if you show it
        to my satisfaction, I will glorify your wisdom as long as I live.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> But perhaps this is no small task, Socrates; though I
        could show you quite clearly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> I understand; it is because you think I am slower to
        understand than the judges; since it is plain that you will show them
        that such acts are wrong and that all the gods hate them.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Quite clearly, Socrates; that is, if they listen to
        me.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> They will listen, if they find that you are a good
        speaker.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this occurred to me while you were talking, and I said to myself:
        “If Euthyphro should prove to me no matter how clearly that all the gods
        think such a death is wrongful, what have I learned from Euthyphro about
        the question, what is holiness and what is unholiness? For this act
        would, as it seems, be hateful to the gods; but we saw just now that
        holiness and its opposite are not defined in this way; for we saw that
        what is hateful to the gods is also dear to them; and so I let you off
        any discussion of this point,
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> If you like, all the gods
      </p>

      <p>
        may think it wrong and may hate it. But shall we now emend our
        definition and say that whatever all the gods hate is unholy and
        whatever they all love is holy, and what some love and others hate is
        neither or both? Do you wish this now to be our definition of holiness
        and unholiness?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> What is to hinder, Socrates?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Nothing, so far as I am concerned, Euthyphro, but
        consider your own position, whether by adopting this definition you will
        most easily teach me what you promised.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Well, I should say that what all the gods love is holy
        and, on the other hand, what they all hate is unholy.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then shall we examine this again, Euthyphro, to see if
        it is correct, or shall we let it go and accept our own statement, and
        those of others, agreeing that it is so, if anyone merely says that it
        is? Or ought we to inquire into the correctness of the statement?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> We ought to inquire. However, I think this is now
        correct.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> We shall soon know more about this, my friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just consider this question:—Is that which is holy loved by the gods
        because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I don't know what you mean, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then I will try to speak more clearly. We speak of
        being carried and of carrying, of being led and of leading, of being
        seen and of seeing; and you understand—do you not?—that in all such
        expressions the two parts differ one from the other in meaning, and how
        they differ.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I think I understand.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then, too, we conceive of a thing being loved and of a
        thing loving, and the two are different?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Of course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Socrates. Now tell me, is a thing which is carried a carried thing
        because one carries it, or for some other reason?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> No, for that reason.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And a thing which is led is led because one leads it,
        and a thing which is seen is so because one sees it?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then one does not see it because its a seen thing, but,
        on the contrary, it is a seen thing because one sees it; and one does
        not lead it because it is a led thing, but it is a led thing because one
        leads it; and one does not carry it because it is a carried thing, but
        it is a carried thing because one carries it. Is it clear, Euthyphro,
      </p>

      <p>
        what I am trying to say? I am trying to say this, that if anything
        becomes or undergoes, it does not become because it is in a state of
        becoming, but it is in a state of becoming because it becomes, and it
        does not undergo because it is a thing which undergoes, but because it
        undergoes it is a thing which undergoes; or do you not agree to this?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I agree.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Is not that which is beloved a thing which is either
        becoming or undergoing something?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And is this case like the former ones: those who love
        it do not love it because it is a bad thing, but it is a beloved thing
        because they love it?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Obviously.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Now what do you say about that which is holy,
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> It is loved by all the gods, is it not, according to
        what you said?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> For this reason, because it is holy, or for some other
        reason?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> No, for this reason.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> It is loved because it is holy, not holy because it is
        loved?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I think so.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But that which is dear to the gods is dear to them and
        beloved by them because they love it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Of course.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then that which is dear to the gods and that which is
        holy are not identical, but differ one from the other.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> How so, Socrates?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Because we are agreed that the holy is loved because it
        is holy and that it is not holy because it is loved; are we not?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But we are agreed that what is dear to the gods is dear
        to them because they love it, that is, by reason of this love, not that
        they love it because it is dear.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Very true.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But if that which is dear to the gods and that which is
        holy were identical, my dear Euthyphro, then if the holy
      </p>

      <p>
        were loved because it is holy, that which is dear to the gods would be
        loved because it is dear, and if that which is dear to the gods is dear
        because it is loved, then that which is holy would be holy because it is
        loved; but now you see that the opposite is the case, showing that the
        two are different from each other. For the one becomes lovable from the
        fact that it is loved, whereas the other is loved because it is in
        itself lovable. And, Euthyphro, it seems that when you were asked what
        holiness is you were unwilling to make plain its essence, but you
        mentioned something that has happened to this holiness, namely,
      </p>

      <p>
        that it is loved by the gods. But you did not tell as yet what it really
        is. So, if you please, do not hide it from me, but begin over again and
        tell me what holiness is, no matter whether it is loved by the gods or
        anything else happens it; for we shall not quarrel about that. But tell
        me frankly, What is holiness, and what is unholiness?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> But, Socrates, I do not know how to say what I mean.
        For whatever statement we advance, somehow or other it moves about and
        won't stay where we put it.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Your statements, Euthyphro,
      </p>

      <p>
        are like works of my ancestor Daedalus, and if I were the one who made
        or advanced them, you might laugh at me and say that on account of my
        relationship to him my works in words run away and won't stay where they
        are put. But now—well, the statements are yours; so some other jest is
        demanded; for they stay fixed, as you yourself see.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I think the jest does very well as it is;
      </p>

      <p>
        for I am not the one who makes these statements move about and not stay
        in the same place, but you are the Daedalus; for they would have stayed,
        so far as I am concerned.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Apparently then, my friend, I am a more clever artist
        than Daedalus, inasmuch as he made only his own works move, whereas I,
        as it seems, give motion to the works of others as well as to my own.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the most exquisite thing about my art is that I am clever against my
        will; for I would rather have my words stay fixed and stable than
        possess the wisdom of Daedalus and the wealth of Tantalus besides. But
        enough of this. Since you seem to be indolent, I will aid you myself, so
        that you may instruct me about holiness. And do not give it up
        beforehand. Just see whether you do not think that everything that is
        holy is right.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I do.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But is everything that is right also holy?
      </p>

      <p>
        Or is all which is holy right, and not all which is right holy, but part
        of it holy and part something else?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I can't follow you, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And yet you are as much younger than I as you are
        wiser; but, as I said, you are indolent on account of your wealth of
        wisdom. But exert yourself, my friend; for it is not hard to understand
        what I mean. What I mean is the opposite of what the poet said, who
        wrote: “Zeus the creator, him who made all things,”
      </p>

      <p>
        “thou wilt not name; for where fear is, there also is reverence.” Now I
        disagree with the poet. Shall I tell you how?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> By all means.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> It does not seem to me true that where fear is, there
        also is reverence; for many who fear diseases and poverty and other such
        things seem to me to fear, but not to reverence at all these things
        which they fear. Don't you think so, too?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But I think that where reverence is, there also is
        fear; for does not everyone who has a feeling of reverence and shame
        about any act
      </p>

      <p>
        also dread and fear the reputation for wickedness?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, he does fear.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then it is not correct to say “where fear is, there
        also is reverence.” On the contrary, where reverence is, there also is
        fear; but reverence is not everywhere where fear is, since, as I think,
        fear is more comprehensive than reverence; for reverence is a part of
        fear, just as the odd is a part of number, so that it is not true that
        where number is, there also is the odd, but that where the odd is, there
        also is number. Perhaps you follow me now?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Perfectly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> It was something of this sort that I meant before, when
        I asked whether where the right is, there also is holiness, or where
        holiness is,
      </p>

      <p>
        there also is the right; but holiness is not everywhere where the right
        is, for holiness is a part of the right. Do we agree to this, or do you
        dissent?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> No, I agree; for I think the statement is correct.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Now observe the next point. If holiness is a part of
        the right, we must, apparently, find out what part of the right holiness
        is. Now if you asked me about one of the things I just mentioned, as,
        for example, what part of number the even was, and what kind of a number
        it was I should say, “that which is not indivisible by two, but
        divisible by two”; or don't you agree?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I agree.
      </p>

      <p>
        Socrates. Now try in your turn to teach me what part of the right
        holiness is, that I may tell Meletus not to wrong me any more or bring
        suits against me for impiety, since I have now been duly instructed by
        you about what is, and what is not, pious and holy.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> This then is my opinion, Socrates, that the part of
        the right which has to do with attention to the gods constitutes piety
        and holiness, and that the remaining part of the right is that which has
        to do with the service of men.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> I think you are correct, Euthyphro;
      </p>

      <p>
        but there is one little point about which I still want information, for
        I do not yet understand what you mean by “attention.” I don't suppose
        you mean the same kind of attention to the gods which is paid to other
        things. We say, for example, that not everyone knows how to attend to
        horses, but only he who is skilled in horsemanship, do we not?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then horsemanship is the art of attending to horses?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And not everyone knows how to attend to dogs, but only
        the huntsman?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> That is so.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then the huntsman's art is the art of attending to
        dogs?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And the oxherd's art is that of attending to oxen?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And holiness and piety is the art of attending to the
        gods? Is that what you mean, Euthyphro?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Now does attention always aim to accomplish the same
        end? I mean something like this: It aims at some good or benefit to the
        one to whom it is given, as you see that horses, when attended to by the
        horseman's art are benefited and made better; or don't you think so?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, I do.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And dogs are benefited by the huntsman's art
      </p>

      <p>
        and oxen by the oxherd's and everything else in the same way? Or do you
        think care and attention are ever meant for the injury of that which is
        cared for?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> No, by Zeus, I do not.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But for its benefit?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Of course.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then holiness, since it is the art of attending to the
        gods, is a benefit to the gods, and makes them better? And you would
        agree that when you do a holy or pious act you are making one of the
        gods better?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> No, by Zeus, not I.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Nor do I, Euthyphro, think that is what you meant. Far
        from it. But I asked what you meant by
      </p>

      <p>
        “attention to the gods” just because I did not think you meant anything
        like that.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> You are right, Socrates; that is not what I mean.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Well, what kind of attention to the gods is holiness?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> The kind, Socrates, that servants pay to their
        masters.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> I understand. It is, you mean, a kind of service to the
        gods?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Exactly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Now can you tell me what result the art that serves the
        physician serves to produce? Is it not health?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Well then; what is it which the art
      </p>

      <p>
        that serves shipbuilders serves to produce?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Evidently, Socrates, a ship.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And that which serves housebuilders serves to build a
        house?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then tell me, my friend; what would the art which
        serves the gods serve to accomplish? For it is evident that you know,
        since you say you know more than any other man about matters which have
        to do with the gods.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> And what I say is true, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then, in the name of Zeus, tell me, what is that
        glorious result which the gods accomplish by using us as servants?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> They accomplish many fine results, Socrates.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Yes, and so do generals, my friend; but nevertheless,
        you could easily tell the chief of them, namely, that they bring about
        victory in war. Is that not the case?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Of course.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And farmers also, I think, accomplish many fine
        results; but still the chief result of their work is food from the land?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> But how about the many fine results the gods
        accomplish? What is the chief result of their work?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I told you a while ago, Socrates,
      </p>

      <p>
        that it is a long task to learn accurately all about these things.
        However, I say simply that when one knows how to say and do what is
        gratifying to the gods, in praying and sacrificing, that is holiness,
        and such things bring salvation to individual families and to states;
        and the opposite of what is gratifying to the gods is impious, and that
        overturns and destroys everything.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> You might, if you wished, Euthyphro, have answered much
        more briefly the chief part of my question. But it is plain that you do
        not care to instruct me.
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, when you were close upon it you turned aside; and if you had
        answered it, I should already have obtained from you all the instruction
        I need about holiness. But, as things are, the questioner must follow
        the one questioned wherever he leads. What do you say the holy, or
        holiness, is? Do you not say that it is a kind of science of sacrificing
        and praying?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And sacrificing is making gifts to the gods
      </p>

      <p>
        and praying is asking from them?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Exactly, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then holiness, according to this definition, would be a
        science of giving and asking.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> You understand perfectly what I said, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Yes, my friend, for I am eager for your wisdom, and
        give my mind to it, so that nothing you say shall fall to the ground.
        But tell me, what is this service of the gods? Do you say that it
        consists in asking from them and giving to them?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Would not the right way of asking be to ask of them
        what we need from them?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> What else?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And the right way of giving, to present them with
      </p>

      <p>
        what they need from us? For it would not be scientific giving to give
        anyone what he does not need.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> You are right, Socrates.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then holiness would be an art of barter between gods
        and men?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, of barter, if you like to call it so.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> I don't like to call it so, if it is not true. But tell
        me, what advantage accrues to the gods from the gifts they get from us?
        For everybody knows what they give,
      </p>

      <p>
        since we have nothing good which they do not give. But what advantage do
        they derive from what they get from us? Or have we so much the better of
        them in our bartering that we get all good things from them and they
        nothing from us?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Why you don't suppose, Socrates, that the gods gain
        any advantage from what they get from us, do you?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Well then, what would those gifts of ours to the gods
        be?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> What else than honor and praise, and, as I said
        before, gratitude?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then, Euthyphro, holiness is grateful to the gods, but
        not advantageous or precious to the gods?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> I think it is precious, above all things.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then again, it seems, holiness is that which is
        precious to the gods.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then will you be surprised, since you say this, if your
        words do not remain fixed but walk about, and will you accuse me of
        being the Daedalus who makes them walk, when you are yourself much more
        skilful than Daedalus and make them go round in a circle? Or do you not
        see
      </p>

      <p>
        that our definition has come round to the point from which it started?
        For you remember, I suppose, that a while ago we found that holiness and
        what is dear to the gods were not the same, but different from each
        other; or do you not remember?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Yes, I remember.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then don't you see that now you say that what is
        precious to the gods is holy? And is not this what is dear to the gods?
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Certainly.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then either our agreement a while ago was wrong, or if
        that was right, we are wrong now.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> So it seems.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Then we must begin again at the beginning and ask what
        holiness is. Since I shall not willingly give up until I learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        And do not scorn me, but by all means apply your mind now to the utmost
        and tell me the truth; for you know, if anyone does, and like Proteus,
        you must be held until you speak. For if you had not clear knowledge of
        holiness and unholiness, you would surely not have undertaken to
        prosecute your aged father for murder for the sake of a servant. You
        would have been afraid to risk the anger of the gods, in case your
        conduct should be wrong, and would have been ashamed in the sight of
        men. But now I am sure
      </p>

      <p>
        you think you know what is holy and what is not. So tell me, most
        excellent Euthyphro, and do not conceal your thought.
        <br />
        <b>Euthyphro:</b> Some other time, Socrates. Now I am in a hurry and it
        is time for me to go.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Oh my friend, what are you doing? You go away and leave
        me cast down from the high hope I had that I should learn from you what
        is holy, and what is not, and should get rid of Meletus's indictment by
        showing him
      </p>

      <p>
        that I have been made wise by Euthyphro about divine matters and am no
        longer through ignorance acting carelessly and making innovations in
        respect to them, and that I shall live a better life henceforth.
      </p>
