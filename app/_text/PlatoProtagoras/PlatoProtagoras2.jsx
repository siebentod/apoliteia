          A Friend, Socrates, Hippocrates, Protagoras, Alcibiades, Callias,
          Critias, Prodicus, Hippias
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Friend:</b> Where have you been now, Socrates? Ah, but of course you
        have been in chase of Alcibiades and his youthful beauty! Well, only the
        other day, as I looked at him, I thought him still handsome as a man—for
        a man he is, Socrates, between you and me, and with quite a growth of
        beard.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> And what of that? Do you mean to say you do not approve
        of Homer,
      </p>

      <p>
        who said that youth has highest grace in him whose beard is appearing,
        as now in the case of Alcibiades?
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> Then how is the affair at present? Have you been with him
        just now? And how is the young man treating you?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Quite well, I considered, and especially so today: for
        he spoke a good deal on my side, supporting me in a discussion—in fact I
        have only just left him. However, there is a strange thing I have to
        tell you: although he was present, I not merely paid him no attention,
        but at times forgot him altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Friend:</b> Why, what can have happened between you and him?
        Something serious! For surely you did not find anyone else of greater
        beauty there,—no, not in our city.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Yes, of far greater.
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> What do you say? One of our people, or a foreigner?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> A foreigner.
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> Of what city?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Abdera.
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> And you found this foreigner so beautiful that he
        appeared to you of greater beauty than the son of Cleinias?
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Why, my good sir, must not the wisest appear more
        beautiful?
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> Do you mean it was some wise man that you met just now?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Nay, rather the wisest of our generation, I may tell
        you, if “wisest” is what you agree to call Protagoras.
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> Ah, what a piece of news! Protagoras come to town!
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Yes, two days ago.
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> And it was his company that you left just now?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Socrates:</b> Yes, and a great deal I said to him, and he to me.
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> Then do let us hear your account of the conversation at
        once, if you are disengaged take my boy's place, and sit here.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> Very good indeed, I shall be obliged to you, if you
        will listen.
        <br />
        <b>Friend:</b> And we also to you, I assure you, if you will tell us.
        <br />
        <b>Socrates:</b> A twofold obligation. Well now, listen. During this
        night just past, in the small hours, Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus and
        brother of Phason, knocked violently at my door with his stick,
      </p>

      <p>
        and when they opened to him he came hurrying in at once and calling to
        me in a loud voice: Socrates, are you awake, or sleeping? Then I,
        recognizing his voice, said: Hippocrates, hallo! Some news to break to
        me? Only good news, he replied. Tell it, and welcome, I said: what is
        it, and what business brings you here at such an hour? Protagoras has
        come, he said, standing at my side. Yes, two days ago, I said: have you
        only just heard? Yes, by Heaven! he replied,
      </p>

      <p>
        last evening. With this he groped about for the bedstead, and sitting
        down by my feet he said: It was in the evening, after I had got in very
        late from Oenoe. My boy Satyrus, you see, had run away: I meant to let
        you know I was going in chase of him, but some other matter put it out
        of my head. On my return, when we had finished dinner and were about to
        retire, my brother told me, only then, that Protagoras had come. I made
        an effort, even at that hour, to get to you at once, but came to the
        conclusion that it was too late at night.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as soon as I had slept off my fatigue I got up at once and made my
        way straight here. Then I, noting the man's gallant spirit and the
        flutter he was in, remarked: Well, what is that to you? Has Protagoras
        wronged you? At this he laughed and, Yes, by the gods! he said, by being
        the only wise man, and not making me one. But, by Zeus! I said, if you
        give him a fee and win him over he will make you wise too. Would to Zeus
        and all the gods, he exclaimed,
      </p>

      <p>
        only that were needed! I should not spare either my own pocket or those
        of my friends. But it is on this very account I have come to you now, to
        see if you will have a talk with him on my behalf: for one thing, I am
        too young to do it myself; and for another, I have never yet seen
        Protagoras nor heard him speak a word—I was but a child when he paid us
        his previous visit. You know, Socrates, how everyone praises the man and
        tells of his mastery of speech: let us step over to him at once,
      </p>

      <p>
        to make sure of finding him in; he is staying, so I was told, with
        Callias, son of Hipponicus. Now, let us be going. To this I replied: We
        had better not go there yet, my good friend, it is so very early: let us
        rise and turn into the court here, and spend the time strolling there
        till daylight comes; after that we can go. Protagoras, you see, spends
        most of his time indoors, so have no fear, we shall find him in all
        right, most likely.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So then we got up and strolled in the court;
      </p>

      <p>
        and I, to test Hippocrates' grit, began examining him with a few
        questions. Tell me, Hippocrates, I said, in your present design of going
        to Protagoras and paying him money as a fee for his services to
        yourself, to whom do you consider you are resorting, and what is it that
        you are to become? Suppose, for example, you had taken it into your head
        to call on your namesake Hippocrates of Cos, the Asclepiad, and pay him
        money as your personal fee, and suppose someone asked you—Tell me,
        Hippocrates, in purposing to pay
      </p>

      <p>
        a fee to Hippocrates, what do you consider him to be? How would you
        answer that?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        A doctor, I would say.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And what would you intend to become?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        A doctor, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And suppose you had a mind to approach Polycleitus the Argive or
        Pheidias the Athenian and pay them a personal fee, and somebody asked
        you—What is it that you consider Polycleitus or Pheidias to be, that you
        are minded to pay them this money? What would your answer be to that?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Sculptors, I would reply.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And what would you intend to become?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Obviously, a sculptor.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Very well then, I said; you and I will go now to Protagoras,
      </p>

      <p>
        prepared to pay him money as your fee,from our own means if they are
        adequate for the purpose of prevailing on him, but if not, then drawing
        on our friends' resources to make up the sum. Now if anyone, observing
        our extreme earnestness in the matter, should ask us,—Pray, Socrates and
        Hippocrates, what is it that you take Protagoras to be, when you purpose
        to pay him money? What should we reply to him? What is the other name
        that we commonly hear attached to Protagoras? They call Pheidias a
        sculptor and Homer a poet:
      </p>

      <p>
        what title do they give Protagoras?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        A sophist, to be sure, Socrates, is what they call him.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then we go to him and pay him the money as a sophist?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now suppose someone asked you this further question:
      </p>

      <p>
        And what is it that you yourself hope to become when you go to
        Protagoras ?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To this he replied with a blush—for by then there was a glimmer of
        daylight by which I could see him quite clearly—If it is like the
        previous cases, obviously, to become a sophist.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In Heaven's name, I said, would you not be ashamed to present yourself
        before the Greeks as a sophist?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, on my soul I should, Socrates, if I am to speak my real thoughts.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yet after all, Hippocrates, perhaps it is not this sort of learning that
        you expect to get from Protagoras, but rather the sort you had
      </p>

      <p>
        from your language-master, your harp-teacher, and your
        sports-instructor; for when you took your lessons from each of these it
        was not in the technical way, with a view to becoming a professional,
        but for education, as befits a private gentleman.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I quite agree, he said it is rather this kind of learning that one gets
        from Protagoras.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then are you aware what you are now about to do, or is it not clear to
        you? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To what do you refer?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I mean your intention of submitting your soul
      </p>

      <p>
        to the treatment of a man who, as you say, is a sophist; and as to what
        a sophist really is, I shall be surprised if you can tell me. And yet,
        if you are ignorant of this, you cannot know to whom you are entrusting
        your soul,—whether it is to something good or to something evil.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I really think, he said, that I know.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then tell me, please, what you consider a sophist to be.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I should say, he replied, from what the name implies, that he is one who
        has knowledge of wise matters.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I went on, we are able to say this of painters also, and of
        carpenters,—that they are the persons who have knowledge of wise
        matters;
      </p>

      <p>
        and if someone asked us for what those matters are wise, of which
        painters have knowledge, I suppose we should tell him that they are wise
        for the production of likenesses, and similarly with the rest. But if he
        should ask for what the matters of the sophist are wise, how should we
        answer him? What sort of workmanship is he master of?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How should we describe him, Socrates,—as a master of making one a clever
        speaker?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Perhaps, I replied, we should be speaking the truth, but yet not all the
        truth; for our answer still calls for a question, as to the subject on
        which the sophist makes one a clever speaker: just as the harp player
      </p>

      <p>
        makes one clever, I presume, at speaking on the matter of which he gives
        one knowledge, namely harp-playing,—you agree to that?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, about what does the sophist make one a clever speaker?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Clearly it must be the same thing as that of which he gives one
        knowledge.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So it would seem: now what is this thing, of which the sophist himself
        has knowledge and gives knowledge to his pupil?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Ah, there, in good faith, he said, I fail to find you an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I then went on to say: Now tell me, are you aware upon what sort of
        hazard you are going to stake your soul? If you had to entrust your body
        to someone, taking the risk of its being made better or worse, you would
        first consider most carefully whether you ought to entrust it or not,
        and would seek the advice of your friends and relations and ponder it
        for a number of days: but in the case of your soul, which you value much
        more highly than your body, and on which depends the good or ill
        condition of all your affairs, according as it is made better or worse,
        would you omit to consult first with either your father
      </p>

      <p>
        or your brother or one of us your comrades,—as to whether or no you
        should entrust your very soul to this newly-arrived foreigner; but
        choose rather, having heard of him in the evening, as you say, and
        coming to me at dawn, to make no mention of this question, and take no
        counsel upon it—whether you ought to entrust yourself to him or not; and
        are ready to spend your own substance and that of your friends, in the
        settled conviction that at all costs you must converse with Protagoras,
        whom you neither know, as you tell me, nor have ever met in argument
        before,
      </p>

      <p>
        and whom you call “sophist,” in patent ignorance of what this sophist
        may be to whom you are about to entrust yourself?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When he heard this he said: It seems so, Socrates, by what you say.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then can it be, Hippocrates, that the sophist is really a sort of
        merchant or dealer in provisions on which a soul is nourished? For such
        is the view I take of him.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        With what, Socrates, is a soul nourished?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        With doctrines, presumably, I replied. And we must take care, my good
        friend, that the sophist, in commending his wares, does not deceive us,
        as both merchant and dealer do in the case of our bodily food.
      </p>

      <p>
        For among the provisions, you know, in which these men deal, not only
        are they themselves ignorant what is good or bad for the body, since in
        selling they commend them all, but the people who buy from them are so
        too, unless one happens to be a trainer or a doctor. And in the same
        way, those who take their doctrines the round of our cities, hawking
        them about to any odd purchaser who desires them, commend everything
        that they sell, and there may well be some of these too, my good sir,
        who are ignorant which of their wares is
      </p>

      <p>
        good or bad for the soul; and in just the same case are the people who
        buy from them, unless one happens to have a doctor's knowledge here
        also, but of the soul. So then, if you are well informed as to what is
        good or bad among these wares, it will be safe for you to buy doctrines
        from Protagoras or from anyone else you please: but if not, take care,
        my dear fellow, that you do not risk your greatest treasure on a toss of
        the dice.
      </p>

      <p>
        For I tell you there is far more serious risk in the purchase of
        doctrines than in that of eatables. When you buy victuals and liquors
        you can carry them off from the dealer or merchant in separate vessels,
        and before you take them into your body by drinking or eating you can
        lay them in your house and take the advice of an expert whom you can
        call in, as to what is fit to eat or drink and what is not, and how much
        you should take and when; so that in this purchase the risk is not
        serious.
      </p>

      <p>
        But you cannot carry away doctrines in a separate vessel: you are
        compelled, when you have handed over the price, to take the doctrine in
        your very soul by learning it, and so to depart either an injured or a
        benefited man. These, then, are questions which we have to consider with
        the aid of our elders, since we ourselves are still rather young to
        unravel so great a matter. For the moment, however, let us pursue our
        design and go and hear this person; and when we have heard him we shall
        proceed to consult others: for Protagoras is not the only one there; we
        shall find Hippias of Elis
      </p>

      <p>
        and, I believe, Prodicus of Ceos, and numerous other men of wisdom
        besides.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        This we resolved on, and set forth; and when we arrived at the doorway,
        we stood discussing some question or other that had occurred to us by
        the way: so, not to leave it unfinished, but to get it settled before we
        went in, we stood there and discussed in front of the door, until we had
        come to an agreement with each other. Now, I fancy the doorkeeper, who
        was a eunuch, overheard us; very likely
      </p>

      <p>
        the great number of sophists has made him annoyed with callers at the
        house: at any rate, when we had knocked on the door, he opened it and,
        on seeing us,—Hullo, he said, sophists there! Master is engaged. So
        saying, he seized the door with both hands and very smartly clapped it
        to with all his might. We tried knocking again, and then he spoke in
        answer through the closed door,—Sirs, have you not heard, he is engaged?
        But, my good fellow, I said, we have not come to see Callias,
      </p>

      <p>
        nor are we sophists. Have no fear: I tell you, we have come to ask if we
        may see Protagoras; so go and announce us. Then with much hesitation the
        fellow opened the door to us and when we had entered, we came upon
        Protagoras as he was walking round in the cloister, and close behind him
        two companies were walking round also; on the one side Callias, son of
        Hipponicus and his brother on the mother's side,
      </p>

      <p>
        Paralus, son of Pericles, and Charmides, son of Glaucon, while the other
        troop consisted of Pericles' other son Xanthippus, Philippides, son of
        Philomelus, and Antimoerus of Mende, who is the most highly reputed of
        Protagoras' disciples and is taking the course professionally with a
        view to becoming a sophist. The persons who followed in their rear,
        listening to what they could of the talk, seemed to e mostly strangers,
        brought by the great Protagoras from the several cities which he
        traverses, enchanting them with his voice like Orpheus, while they
        follow
      </p>

      <p>
        where the voice sounds, enchanted; and some of our own inhabitants were
        also dancing attendance. As for me, when I saw their evolutions I was
        delighted with the admirable care they took not to hinder Protagoras at
        any moment by getting in front; but whenever the master turned about and
        those with him, it was fine to see the orderly manner in which his train
        of listeners split up into two parties on this side and on that, and
        wheeling round formed up again each time in his rear most admirably.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        &ldquo;And next did I mark,&rdquo; as Homer says, Hippias of Elis,
      </p>

      <p>
        seated high on a chair in the doorway opposite; and sitting around him
        on benches were Eryximachus, son of Acumenus, Phaedrus of Myrrhinous,
        Andron son of Androtion and a number of strangers,—fellow-citizens of
        Hippias and some others. They seemed to be asking him a series of
        astronomical questions on nature and the heavenly bodies, while he,
        seated in his chair, was distinguishing and expounding to each in turn
        the subjects of their questions. &ldquo;Nay more, Tantalus also did I
        there behold.&rdquo; —for you know Prodicus of Ceos is in Athens too:
      </p>

      <p>
        he was in a certain apartment formerly used by Hipponieus as a
        strong-room, but now cleared out by Callias to make more space for his
        numerous visitors, and turned into a guest-chamber. Well, Prodicus was
        still abed, wrapped up in sundry fleeces and rugs, and plenty of them
        too, it seemed; and near him on the beds hard by lay Pausanias from
        Cerames, and with Pausanias a lad who was still quite young, of good
        birth and breeding, I should say,
      </p>

      <p>
        and at all events a very good-looking person. I fancied I heard his name
        was Agathon, and I should not be surprised to find he is Pausanias'
        favorite. Besides this youth there were the two Adeimantuses, sons of
        Cepis and Leucolophidas, and there seemed to be some others. The
        subjects of their conversation I was unable to gather from outside,
        despite my longing to hear Prodicus; for I regard the man as all-wise
        and divine:
      </p>

      <p>
        but owing to the depth of his voice the room was filled with a booming
        sound which made the talk indistinct.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We had only just come in, when close on our heels entered Alcibiades the
        good-looking, as you call him and I agree that he is, and Critias, son
        of Callaeschrus. So, when we had entered, after some more little delays
        over certain points we had to examine, we went up to Protagoras,
      </p>

      <p>
        and I said: Protagoras, you see we have come to you, Hippocrates and I.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Is it your wish, he asked, to converse with me alone, or in company with
        others?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It is all the same to us, I replied: let me first tell you our object in
        coming, and then you must decide.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, what is your object? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        My friend Hippocrates is a native of the city, a son of Apollodorus and
        one of a great and prosperous family, while his own natural powers seem
        to make him a match for anyone of his age.
      </p>

      <p>
        I fancy he is anxious to gain consideration in our city, and he believes
        he can best gain it by consorting with you. So now it is for you to
        judge whether it will be fittest for you to converse on this matter
        privately with us alone, or in company with others.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You do right, Socrates, he said, to he so thoughtful on my behalf. For
        when one goes as a stranger into great cities, and there tries to
        persuade the best of the young men to drop their other connexions,
        either with their own folk or with foreigners, both old and young, and
        to join one's own circle, with the promise of improving them by this
        connexion with oneself,
      </p>

      <p>
        such a proceeding requires great caution; since very considerable
        jealousies are apt to ensue, and numerous enmities and intrigues. Now I
        tell you that sophistry is an ancient art, and those men of ancient
        times who practised it, fearing the odium it involved, disguised it in a
        decent dress, sometimes of poetry, as in the case of Homer, Hesiod, and
        Simonides sometimes of mystic rites and soothsayings, as did Orpheus,
        Musaeus and their sects; and sometimes too, I have observed, of
        athletics, as with Iccus of Tarentum and another still living—as great a
        sophist as any—
      </p>

      <p>
        Herodicus of Selymbria, originally of Megara; and music was the disguise
        employed by your own Agathocles, a great sophist, Pythocleides of Ceos,
        and many more. All these, as I say, from fear of ill-will made use of
        these arts
      </p>

      <p>
        as outer coverings. But I do not conform to the method of all these
        persons, since I believe they did not accomplish any of their designs:
        for the purpose of all this disguise could not escape the able men of
        affairs in each city; the multitude, of course, perceive practically
        nothing, but merely echo this or that pronouncement of their leaders.
        Now to try to run away, and to fail through being caught in the act,
      </p>

      <p>
        shows sad folly in the mere attempt, and must needs make people far more
        hostile; for they regard such an one, whatever else he may be, as a
        rogue. Hence the road I have taken is one entirely opposite to theirs: I
        admit that I am a sophist and that I educate men; and I consider this
        precaution, of admitting rather than denying, the better of the two.
        There are others besides that I have meditated, so as to avoid, under
        Heaven,
      </p>

      <p>
        any harm that may come of admitting that I am a sophist. And yet many
        long years have I now been in the profession, for many in total number
        are those that I have lived: not one of you all, but in age I might be
        his father. Hence it suits me by far the best, in meeting your wishes,
        to make my discourse on these matters in the presence of all who are in
        the house.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        On this, as I suspected that he wished to make a display before Prodicus
        and Hippias, and give himself airs on the personal attachment shown by
        our coming to him, I remarked:
      </p>

      <p>
        Then surely we must call Prodicus and Hippias and their followers to
        come and listen to us
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By all means, said Protagoras.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you agree, said Callias, to our making a session of it, so that
        we may sit at ease for our conversation?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        The proposal was accepted; and all of us, delighted at the prospect of
        listening to wise men, took hold of the benches and couches ourselves
        and arranged them where Hippias was, since the benches were there
        already. Meanwhile Callias and Alcibiades came,
      </p>

      <p>
        bringing with them Prodicus, whom they had induced to rise from his
        couch, and Prodicus' circle also.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When we had all taken our seats,—So now, Socrates, said Protagoras,
        since these gentlemen are also present, be so good as to tell what you
        were mentioning to me a little while before on the young man's behalf.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To which I replied:
      </p>

      <p>
        The same point, Protagoras, will serve me for a beginning as a moment
        ago, in regard to the object of my visit. My friend Hippocrates finds
        himself desirous of joining your classes; and therefore he says he would
        be glad to know what result he will get from joining them. That is all
        the speech we have to make.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Protagoras answered at once, saying: Young man, you will gain this
        by coming to my classes, that on the day when you join them you will go
        home a better man, and on the day after it will be the same; every day
      </p>

      <p>
        you will constantly improve more and more.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When I heard this I said: Protagoras, what you say is not at all
        surprising, but quite likely, since even you, though so old and so wise,
        would be made better if someone taught you what you happen not to know.
        But let me put it another way: suppose Hippocrates here should change
        his desire all at once, and become desirous of this young fellow's
        lessons who has just recently come to town, Zeuxippus of Heraclea, and
        should approach him, as he now does you,
      </p>

      <p>
        and should hear the very same thing from him as from you,—how on each
        day that he spent with him he would be better and make constant
        progress; and suppose he were to question him on this and ask: In what
        shall I become better as you say, and to what will my progress be?
        Zeuxippus's reply would be, to painting. Then suppose he came to the
        lessons of Orthagoras the Theban, and heard the same thing from him as
        from you, and then inquired of him for what he would be better each day
        through attending his classes, the answer would be, for fluting. In the
        same way you also must satisfy this youth and me
      </p>

      <p>
        on this point, and tell us for what, Protagoras, and in what connexion
        my friend Hippocrates, on any day of attendance at the classes of
        Protagoras, will go away a better man, and on each of the succeeding
        days will make a like advance.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When Protagoras heard my words,—You do right, he said, to ask that,
        while I am only too glad to answer those who ask the right question. For
        Hippocrates, if he comes to me, will not be treated as he would have
        been if he had joined the classes of an ordinary sophist. The generality
        of them maltreat the young; for when they have escaped from the arts
      </p>

      <p>
        they bring them back against their will and force them into arts,
        teaching them arithmetic and astronomy and geometry and music (and here
        he glanced at Hippias); whereas, if he applies to me, he will learn
        precisely and solely that for which he has come. That learning consists
        of good judgement in his own affairs, showing how best to order his own
        home; and in the affairs of his city,
      </p>

      <p>
        showing how he may have most influence on public affairs both in speech
        and in action.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I wonder, I said, whether I follow what you are saying; for you appear
        to be speaking of the civic science, and undertaking to make men good
        citizens.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That, Socrates, he replied, is exactly the purport of what I profess.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then it is a goodly accomplishment that you have acquired, to be sure, I
        remarked, if indeed you have acquired it—to such a man as you I may say
        sincerely what I think. For this is a thing, Protagoras,
      </p>

      <p>
        that I did not suppose to be teachable; but when you say it is, I do not
        see how I am to disbelieve it. How I came to think that it cannot be
        taught, or provided by men for men, I may be allowed to explain. I say,
        in common with the rest of the Greeks, that the Athenians are wise. Now
        I observe, when we are collected for the Assembly, and the city has to
        deal with an affair of building, we send for builders to advise us on
        what is proposed to be built; and when it is a case of laying down a
        ship, we send for shipwrights; and so in all other matters
      </p>

      <p>
        which are considered learnable and teachable: but if anyone else, whom
        the people do not regard as a craftsman, attempts to advise them, no
        matter how handsome and wealthy and well-born he may be, not one of
        these things induces them to accept him; they merely laugh him to scorn
        and shout him down, until either the speaker retires from his attempt,
        overborne by the clamor, or the tipstaves pull him from his place or
        turn him out altogether by order of the chair. Such is their procedure
        in matters which they consider professional. But when they have to
        deliberate on something connected with the administration of the State,
      </p>

      <p>
        the man who rises to advise them on this may equally well be a smith, a
        shoemaker, a merchant, a sea-captain, a rich man, a poor man, of good
        family or of none, and nobody thinks of casting in his teeth, as one
        would in the former case, that his attempt to give advice is justified
        by no instruction obtained in any quarter, no guidance of any master;
        and obviously it is because they hold that here the thing cannot be
        taught. Nay further, it is not only so with the service of the State,
      </p>

      <p>
        but in private life our best and wisest citizens are unable to transmit
        this excellence of theirs to others; for Pericles, the father of these
        young fellows here, gave them a first-rate training in the subjects for
        which he found teachers, but in those of which he is himself a master
      </p>

      <p>
        he neither trains them personally nor commits them to another's
        guidance, and so they go about grazing at will like sacred oxen, on the
        chance of their picking up excellence here or there for themselves. Or,
        if you like, there is Cleinias, the younger brother of Alcibiades here,
        whom this same Pericles, acting as his guardian, and fearing lie might
        be corrupted, I suppose, by Alcibiades, carried off from his brother and
        placed in Ariphron's family to be educated: but before six months had
        passed he handed him back to Alcibiades,
      </p>

      <p>
        at a loss what to do with him. And there are a great many others whom I
        could mention to you as having never succeeded, though virtuous
        themselves, in making anyone else better, either of their own or of
        other families. I therefore, Protagoras, in view of these facts, believe
        that virtue is not teachable: but when I hear you speak thus, I am
        swayed over, and suppose there is something in what you say, because I
        consider you to have gained experience in many things and to have learnt
        many, besides finding out some for yourself. So if you can demonstrate
        to us more explicitly that virtue is teachable,
      </p>

      <p>
        do not grudge us your demonstration.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, Socrates, I will not grudge it you; but shall I, as an old man
        speaking to his juniors, put my demonstration in the form of a fable, or
        of a regular exposition?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Many of the company sitting by him instantly bade him treat his subject
        whichever way he pleased.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, he said, I fancy the more agreeable way is for me to tell you
        a fable.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There was once a time when there were gods, but no mortal creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        And when to these also came their destined time to be created, the gods
        moulded their forms within the earth, of a mixture made of earth and
        fire and all substances that are compounded with fire and earth. When
        they were about to bring these creatures to light, they charged
        Prometheus and Epimetheus to deal to each the equipment of his proper
        faculty. Epimetheus besought Prometheus that he might do the dealing
        himself; “And when I have dealt,” he said, “you shall examine.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Having thus persuaded him he dealt; and in dealing he attached strength
        without speed; to some, while the weaker he equipped with speed; and
        some he armed, while devising for others, along with an unarmed
        condition, some different faculty for preservation. To those which he
        invested with smallness he dealt a winged escape or an underground
        habitation; those which he increased in largeness he preserved
      </p>

      <p>
        by this very means; and he dealt all the other properties on this plan
        of compensation. In contriving all this he was taking precaution that no
        kind should be extinguished; and when he had equipped them with
        avoidances of mutual destruction, he devised a provision against the
        seasons ordained by Heaven, in clothing them about with thick-set hair
        and solid hides, sufficient to ward off winter yet able to shield them
        also from the heats, and so that on going to their lairs they might find
        in these same things a bedding of their own that was native to each; and
        some he shod with hoofs,
      </p>

      <p>
        others with claws and solid, bloodless hides. Then he proceeded to
        furnish each of them with its proper food, some with pasture of the
        earth, others with fruits of trees, and others again with roots; and to
        a certain number for food he gave other creatures to devour: to some he
        attached a paucity in breeding, and to others, which were being consumed
        by these, a plenteous brood, and so procured survival of their kind. Now
        Epimetheus, being not so wise as he might be,
      </p>

      <p>
        heedlessly squandered his stock of properties on the brutes; he still
        had left unequipped the race of men, and was at a loss what to do with
        it. As he was casting about, Prometheus arrived to examine his
        distribution, and saw that whereas the other creatures were fully and
        suitably provided, man was naked, unshod, unbedded, unarmed; and already
        the destined day was come, whereon man like the rest should emerge from
        earth to light. Then Prometheus, in his perplexity as to what
        preservation he could devise for man, stole from Hephaestus and Athena
        wisdom in the arts
      </p>

      <p>
        ogether with fire—since by no means without fire could it be acquired or
        helpfully used by any—and he handed it there and then as a gift to man.
        Now although man acquired in this way the wisdom of daily life, civic
        wisdom he had not, since this was in the possession of Zeus; Prometheus
        could not make so free as to enter the citadel which is the
        dwelling-place of Zeus, and moreover the guards of Zeus were terrible:
        but he entered unobserved the building shared by Athena and Hephaestus
      </p>

      <p>
        for the pursuit of their arts, and stealing Hephaestus's fiery art and
        all Athena's also he gave them to man, and hence it is
      </p>

      <p>
        that man gets facility for his livelihood, but Prometheus, through
        Epimetheus' fault, later on (the story goes) stood his trial for theft.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And now that man was partaker of a divine portion, he, in the first
        place, by his nearness of kin to deity, was the only creature that
        worshipped gods, and set himself to establish altars and holy images;
        and secondly, he soon was enabled by his skill to articulate speech and
        words, and to invent dwellings, clothes, sandals, beds, and the foods
        that are of the earth. Thus far provided, men dwelt separately in the
        beginning, and cities there were none;
      </p>

      <p>
        so that they were being destroyed by the wild beasts, since these were
        in all ways stronger than they; and although their skill in handiwork
        was a sufficient aid in respect of food, in their warfare with the
        beasts it was defective; for as yet they had no civic art, which
        includes the art of war. So they sought to band themselves together and
        secure their lives by founding cities. Now as often as they were banded
        together they did wrong to one another through the lack of civic art,
      </p>

      <p>
        and thus they began to be scattered again and to perish. So Zeus,
        fearing that our race was in danger of utter destruction, sent Hermes to
        bring respect and right among men, to the end that there should be
        regulation of cities and friendly ties to draw them together. Then
        Hermes asked Zeus in what manner then was he to give men right and
        respect: “Am I to deal them out as the arts have been dealt? That
        dealing was done in such wise that one man possessing medical art is
        able to treat many ordinary men, and so with the other craftsmen. Am I
        to place among men right and respect in this way also, or deal them out
        to all?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “To all,” replied Zeus; “let all have their share: for cities cannot be
        formed if only a few have a share of these as of other arts. And make
        thereto a law of my ordaining, that he who cannot partake of respect and
        right shall die the death as a public pest.” Hence it comes about,
        Socrates, that people in cities, and especially in Athens, consider it
        the concern of a few to advise on cases of artistic excellence or good
        craftsmanship,
      </p>

      <p>
        and if anyone outside the few gives advice they disallow it, as you say,
        and not without reason, as I think: but when they meet for a
        consultation on civic art,
      </p>

      <p>
        where they should be guided throughout by justice and good sense, they
        naturally allow advice from everybody, since it is held that everyone
        should partake of this excellence, or else that states cannot be. This,
        Socrates, is the explanation of it. And that you may not think you are
        mistaken, to show how all men verily believe that everyone partakes of
        justice and the rest of civic virtue, I can offer yet a further proof.
        In all other excellences, as you say, when a man professes to be good at
        flute-playing or any other art in which he has no such skill, they
        either laugh him to scorn or are annoyed with him, and his people come
        and reprove him for being so mad:
      </p>

      <p>
        but where justice or any other civic virtue is involved, and they happen
        to know that a certain person is unjust, if he confesses the truth about
        his conduct before the public, that truthfulness which in the former
        arts they would regard as good sense they here call madness. Everyone,
        they say, should profess to be just, whether he is so or not, and
        whoever does not make some pretension to justice is mad; since it is
        held that all without exception
      </p>

      <p>
        must needs partake of it in some way or other, or else not be of human
        kind.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Take my word for it, then, that they have good reason for admitting
        everybody as adviser on this virtue, owing to their belief that everyone
        has some of it; and next, that they do not regard it as natural or
        spontaneous, but as something taught and acquired after careful
        preparation by those who acquire it,—of this I will now endeavor to
        convince you.
      </p>

      <p>
        In all cases of evils which men deem to have befallen their neighbors by
        nature or fortune, nobody is wroth with them or reproves or lectures or
        punishes them, when so afflicted, with a view to their being other than
        they are; one merely pities them. Who, for instance, is such a fool as
        to try to do anything of the sort to the ugly, the puny, or the weak?
        Because, I presume, men know that it is by nature and fortune that
        people get these things, the graces of life and their opposites. But as
        to all the good things that people are supposed to get by application
        and practice and teaching,
      </p>

      <p>
        where these are lacking in anyone and only their opposite evils are
        found, here surely are the occasions for wrath and punishment and
        reproof. One of them is injustice, and impiety, and in short all that is
        opposed
      </p>

      <p>
        to civic virtue; in such case anyone will be wroth with his neighbor and
        reprove him, clearly because the virtue is to be acquired by application
        and learning. For if you will consider punishment, Socrates, and what
        control it has over wrong-doers, the facts will inform you that men
        agree in regarding virtue as procured. No one punishes a wrong-doer from
        the mere contemplation
      </p>

      <p>
        or on account of his wrong-doing, unless one takes unreasoning vengeance
        like a wild beast. But he who undertakes to punish with reason does not
        avenge himself for the past offence, since he cannot make what was done
        as though it had not come to pass; he looks rather to the future, and
        aims at preventing that particular person and others who see him
        punished from doing wrong again. And being so minded he must have in
        mind that virtue comes by training: for you observe that he punishes to
        deter. This then is the accepted view
      </p>

      <p>
        of all who seek requital in either private or public life; and while men
        in general exact requital and punishment from those whom they suppose to
        have wronged them, this is especially the case with the Athenians, your
        fellow-citizens, so that by our argument the Athenians also share the
        view that virtue is procured and taught. Thus I have shown that your
        fellow-citizens have good reason for admitting a smith's or cobbler's
        counsel in public affairs, and that they hold virtue to be taught and
        procured:
      </p>

      <p>
        of this I have given you satisfactory demonstration, Socrates, as it
        appears to me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I have yet to deal with your remaining
        problem about good men, why it is that these good men have their sons
        taught the subjects in the regular teachers' courses, and so far make
        them wise, but do not make them excel in that virtue wherein consists
        their own goodness. On this point, Socrates, I shall give you argument
        instead of fable. Now consider: is there,
      </p>

      <p>
        or is there not, some one thing whereof all the citizens must needs
        partake, if there is to be a city? Here, and nowhere if not here, is the
        solution of this problem of yours. For if there is such a thing, and
        that one thing, instead of being the joiner's or smith's or potter's
        art, is rather justice and temperance and holiness—
      </p>

      <p>
        in short, what I may put together and call a man's virtue; and if it is
        this whereof all should partake and wherewith everyone should proceed to
        any further knowledge or action, but should not if he lacks it; if we
        should instruct and punish such as do not partake of it, whether child
        or husband or wife, until the punishment of such persons has made them
        better,
      </p>

      <p>
        and should cast forth from our cities or put to death as incurable
        whoever fails to respond to such punishment and instruction;—if it is
        like this, and yet, its nature being so, good men have their sons
        instructed in everything else but this, what very surprising folk the
        good are found to be! For we have proved that they regard this thing as
        teachable both in private and in public life, and then, though it may be
        taught and fostered, are we to say that they have their sons taught
        everything in which the penalty for ignorance is not death, but in a
        matter where the death-penalty or exile awaits their children
      </p>

      <p>
        if not instructed and cultivated in virtue—and not merely death, but
        confiscation of property and practically the entire subversion of their
        house—here they do not have them taught or take the utmost care of them?
        So at any rate we must conclude, Socrates.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They teach and admonish them from earliest childhood till the last day
        of their lives. As soon as one of them grasps what is said to him, the
        nurse, the mother, the tutor, and the father himself strive hard
      </p>

      <p>
        that the child may excel, and as each act and word occurs they teach and
        impress upon him that this is just, and that unjust, one thing noble,
        another base, one holy, another unholy, and that he is to do this, and
        not do that. If he readily obeys,—so; but if not, they treat him as a
        bent and twisted piece of wood and straighten him with threats and
        blows. After this they send them to school and charge the master to take
        far more pains over their children's good behavior than over their
        letters
      </p>

      <p>
        and harp-playing. The masters take pains accordingly, and the children,
        when they have learnt their letters and are getting to understand the
        written word as before they did only the spoken, are furnished with
        works of good poets to read as they sit in class, and are made to learn
        them off by heart:
      </p>

      <p>
        here they meet with many admonitions, many descriptions and praises and
        eulogies of good men in times past, that the boy in envy may imitate
        them and yearn to become even as they. Then also the music-masters, in a
        similar sort, take pains for their self-restraint, and see that their
        young charges do not go wrong: moreover, when they learn to play the
        harp, they are taught the works of another set of good poets,
      </p>

      <p>
        the song-makers, while the master accompanies them on the harp; and they
        insist on familiarizing the boys' souls with the rhythms and scales,
        that they may gain in gentleness, and by advancing in rhythmic and
        harmonic grace may be efficient in speech and action; for the whole of
        man's life requires the graces of rhythm and harmony. Again, over and
        above all this, people send their sons to a trainer, that having
        improved their bodies they may perform the orders of their minds,
      </p>

      <p>
        which are now in fit condition, and that they may not be forced by
        bodily faults to play the coward in wars and other duties. This is what
        people do, who are most able; and the most able are the wealthiest.
        Their sons begin school at the earliest age, and are freed from it at
        the latest. And when they are released from their schooling the city
        next compels them to learn the laws and to live according to them as
        after a pattern,
      </p>

      <p>
        that their conduct may not be swayed by their own light fancies, but
        just as writing-masters first draw letters in faint outline with the pen
        for their less advanced pupils, and then give them the copy-book and
        make them write according to the guidance of their lines, so the city
        sketches out for them the laws devised by good lawgivers of yore, and
        constrains them to govern and be governed according to these. She
        punishes anyone who steps outside these borders, and this punishment
        among you and in many other cities,
      </p>

      <p>
        from the corrective purpose of the prosecution, is called a Correction.
        Seeing then that so much care is taken in the matter of both private and
        public virtue, do you wonder, Socrates, and make it a great difficulty,
        that virtue may be taught? Surely there is no reason to wonder at that:
        you would have far greater reason, if it were not so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then why is it that many sons of good fathers turn out so meanly? Let me
        explain this also: it is no wonder, granted that I was right in stating
        just now that no one,
      </p>

      <p>
        if we are to have a city, must be a mere layman in this affair of
        virtue. For if what I say is the case—and it is supremely true—reflect
        on the nature of any other pursuit or study that you choose to mention.
        Suppose that there could be no state unless we were all flute-players,
        in such sort as each was able, and suppose that everyone were giving his
        neighbor both private and public lessons in the art, and rebuked him
        too, if he failed to do it well, without grudging him the trouble—even
        as no one now thinks of grudging
      </p>

      <p>
        or reserving his skill in what is just and lawful as he does in other
        expert knowledge; for our neighbors' justice and virtue, I take it, is
        to our advantage, and consequently we all tell and teach one another
        what is just and lawful—well, if we made the same zealous and ungrudging
        efforts to instruct each other in flute-playing, do you think, Socrates,
        that the good flute-players would be more likely than the bad to have
        sons who were good flute-players? I do not think they would:
      </p>

      <p>
        no, wherever the son had happened to be born with a nature most apt for
        flute-playing, he would be found to have advanced to distinction, and
        where unapt, to obscurity. Often the son of a good player would turn out
        a bad one, and often of a bad, a good. But, at any rate, all would be
        capable players as compared with ordinary persons who had no inkling of
        the art. Likewise in the present case you must regard any man who
        appears to you the most unjust person ever reared among human laws and
        society as a just man and
      </p>

      <p>
        a craftsman of justice, if he had to stand comparison with people who
        lacked education and law courts and laws and any constant compulsion to
        the pursuit of virtue, but were a kind of wild folk such as Pherecrates
        the poet brought on the scene at last year's Lenaeum. Sure enough, if
        you found yourself among such people, as did the misanthropes among his
        chorus, you would be very glad to meet with Eurybatus and Phrynondas,
      </p>

      <p>
        and would bewail yourself with longing for the wickedness of the people
        here. Instead of that you give yourself dainty airs, Socrates, because
        everyone is a teacher of virtue to the extent of his powers, and you
        think there is no teacher. Why, you might as well ask who is a teacher
        of Greek;
      </p>

      <p>
        you would find none anywhere; and I suppose you might ask, who can teach
        the sons of our artisans the very crafts which of course they have
        learnt from their fathers, as far as the father was competent in each
        case, and his friends who followed the same trade,—I say if you asked
        who is to give these further instruction, I imagine it would be hard,
        Socrates, to find them a teacher, but easy enough in the case of those
        starting with no skill at all. And so it must be with virtue and
        everything else; if there is somebody who excels us ever so little
      </p>

      <p>
        in showing the way to virtue, we must be thankful. Such an one I take
        myself to be, excelling all other men in the gift of assisting people to
        become good and true, and giving full value for the fee that I
        charge—nay, so much more than full, that the learner himself admits it.
        For this reason I have arranged my charges on a particular plan: when
        anyone has had lessons from me, if he likes he pays the sum that I ask;
        if not,
      </p>

      <p>
        he goes to a temple, states on oath the value he sets on what he has
        learnt, and disburses that amount. So now, Socrates, I have shown you by
        both fable and argument that virtue is teachable and is so deemed by the
        Athenians, and that it is no wonder that bad sons are born of good
        fathers and good of bad, since even the sons of Polycleitus, companions
        of Paralus and Xanthippus here, are not to be compared with their
        father, and the same is the case in other craftsmen's families. As for
        these two, it is not fair to make this complaint of them yet;
      </p>

      <p>
        there is still hope in their case, for they are young.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        After this great and fine performance Protagoras ceased from speaking.
        As for me, for a good while I was still under his spell and kept on
        looking at him as though he were going to say more, such was my
        eagerness to hear: but when I perceived that he had really come to a
        stop, I pulled myself together, as it were, with an effort, and looking
        at Hippocrates I said: Son of Apollodorus, I am very grateful to you for
        inducing me to come hither;
      </p>

      <p>
        for it is a great treat to have heard what I have heard from Protagoras.
        I used formerly to think that there was no human treatment by which the
        good were made good, but now I am convinced that there is. Only I find
        one slight difficulty, which Protagoras will of course easily explain
        away, since he has explained so many puzzles already. If one should be
        present when any of the public speakers were dealing with
      </p>

      <p>
        these same subjects, one could probably hear similar discourses from
        Pericles or some other able speaker: but suppose you put a question to
        one of them—they are just like books, incapable of either answering you
        or putting a question of their own; if you question even a small point
        in what has been said, just as brazen vessels ring a long time after
        they have been struck and prolong the note unless you put your hand on
        them, these orators too, on being asked a little question,
      </p>

      <p>
        extend their speech over a full-length course. But Protagoras here,
        while able to deliver, as events have shown, a long and excellent
        speech, is also able when questioned to reply briefly, and after asking
        a question to await and accept the answer—accomplishments that few can
        claim. And now, Protagoras, there is one little thing wanting to the
        completeness of what I have got, so please answer me this. You say that
        virtue may be taught, and if there is anybody in the world who could
        convince me, you are the man: but there was a point in your speech
      </p>

      <p>
        at which I wondered, and on which my spirit would fain be satisfied. You
        said that Zeus had sent justice and respect to mankind, and furthermore
        it was frequently stated in your discourse that justice, temperance,
        holiness and the rest were all but one single thing, virtue: pray, now
        proceed to deal with these in more precise exposition, stating whether
        virtue is a single thing, of which justice and temperance and holiness
        are parts,
      </p>

      <p>
        or whether the qualities I have just mentioned are all names of the same
        single thing. This is what I am still hankering after.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, the answer to that is easy, Socrates, he replied: it is that virtue
        is a single thing and the qualities in question are parts of it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do you mean parts, I asked, in the sense of the parts of a face, as
        mouth, nose, eyes, and ears; or, as in the parts of gold, is there no
        difference among the pieces, either between the parts or between a part
        and the whole, except in greatness and smallness?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In the former sense, I think, Socrates; as the parts of the face
      </p>

      <p>
        are to the whole face.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, I continued, when men partake of these portions of virtue, do
        some have one, and some another, or if you get one, must you have them
        all?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means, he replied, since many are brave but unjust, and many again
        are just but not wise.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then are these also parts of virtue,
      </p>

      <p>
        I asked—wisdom and courage?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Most certainly, I should say, he replied and of the parts, wisdom is the
        greatest.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Each of them, I proceeded, is distinct from any other?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Does each also have its particular function? Just as, in the parts of
        the face, the eye is not like the ears, nor is its function the same;
        nor is any of the other parts like another, in its function or in any
        other respect: in the same way, are the parts of virtue unlike each
        other,
      </p>

      <p>
        both in themselves and in their functions? Are they not evidently so, if
        the analogy holds?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, they are so, Socrates, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So then, I went on, among the parts of virtue, no other part is like
        knowledge, or like justice, or like courage, or like temperance, or like
        holiness.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Come now, I said, let us consider together what sort of thing is each of
        these parts. First let us ask,
      </p>

      <p>
        is justice something, or not a thing at all? I think it is; what do you
        say?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So do I, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, suppose someone should ask you and me: Protagoras and
        Socrates, pray tell me this—the thing you named just now, justice, is
        that itself just or unjust? I should reply, it is just: what would your
        verdict be? The same as mine or different?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        The same, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then justice,
      </p>

      <p>
        I should say in reply to our questioner, is of a kind that is just:
        would you also?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now suppose he proceeded to ask us: Do you also speak of a “holiness”?
        We should say we do, I fancy.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you call this a thing also? We should say we do, should we not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He assented again.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do you say this thing itself is of such nature as to be unholy, or holy?
        For my part I should be annoyed at this question, I said, and should
        answer: Hush, my good sir!
      </p>

      <p>
        It is hard to see how anything could be holy, if holiness itself is not
        to be holy! And you—would you not make the same reply?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly I would, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now suppose he went on to ask us: Well, and what of your statement a
        little while since? Perhaps I did not hear you aright, but I understood
        you two to say that the parts of virtue are in such a relation to each
        other that one of them is not like another. Here my answer would be: As
        to the substance of it, you heard aright, but you made a mistake in
        thinking that I had any share in that statement.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was Protagoras here who made that answer; I was only the questioner.
        Then suppose he were to ask: Is our friend telling the truth,
        Protagoras? Is it you who say that one part of virtue is not like
        another? Is this statement yours? What answer would you give him?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I must needs admit it, Socrates, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, Protagoras, after that admission, what answer shall we give
        him, if he goes on to ask this question: Is not holiness something of
        such nature as to be just, and justice such as to be holy, or can it be
        unholy? Can holiness be not just, and therefore unjust, and justice
        unholy?
      </p>

      <p>
        What is to be our reply? I should say myself, on my own behalf, that
        both justice is holy and holiness just, and with your permission I would
        make this same reply for you also; since justness is either the same
        thing as holiness or extremely like it, and above all, justice is of the
        same kind as holiness, and holiness as justice. Are you minded to forbid
        this answer, or are you in agreement with it?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I do not take quite so simple a view of it,
        Socrates,
      </p>

      <p>
        as to grant that justice is holy and holiness just. I think we have to
        make a distinction here. Yet what difference does it make? he said: if
        you like, let us assume that justice is holy and holiness just.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, no, I said; I do not want this “if you like” or “if you agree” sort
        of thing to be put to the proof, but you and me together; and when I say
        “you and me” I mean that our statement will be most properly tested
      </p>

      <p>
        if we take away the “if.”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, at any rate, he said, justice has some resemblance to holiness;
        for anything in the world has some sort of resemblance to any other
        thing. Thus there is a point in which white resembles black, and hard
        soft, and so with all the other things which are regarded as most
        opposed to each other; and the things which we spoke of before as having
        different faculties and not being of the same kind as each other—the
        parts of the face—these in some sense resemble one another and are of
        like sort. In this way therefore you could prove, if you chose,
      </p>

      <p>
        that even these things are all like one another. But it is not fair to
        describe things as like which have some point alike, however small, or
        ash unlike that have some point unlike.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        This surprised me, and I said to him: What, do you regard just and holy
        as so related to each other that they have only some small point of
        likeness?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not so, he replied, at all, nor yet,
      </p>

      <p>
        on the other hand, as I believe you regard them.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, I said, since I find you chafe at this suggestion, we will
        let it pass, and consider another instance that you gave. Is there a
        thing you call folly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Is not the direct opposite to that thing wisdom?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I think so, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And when men behave rightly and usefully, do you consider them temperate
        in so behaving, or the opposite?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Temperate, he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then is it by temperance that they are temperate?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Necessarily.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now those who do not behave rightly behave foolishly, and are not
        temperate in so behaving?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I agree, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And behaving foolishly is the opposite to behaving temperately?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now foolish behavior is due to folly, and temperate behavior to
        temperance?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And whatever is done by strength is done strongly, and whatever by
        weakness, weakly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And whatever with swiftness, swiftly, and whatever with slowness, slowly
        ?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And so whatever is done in a certain way is done by that kind of
        faculty, and whatever in an opposite way, by the opposite kind?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Pray now, I proceeded, is there such a thing as the beautiful?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He granted it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Has this any opposite except the ugly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        None.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, is there such a thing as the good?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Has it any opposite but the evil?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        None.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Tell me, is there such a thing as “shrill” in the voice?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Has it any other opposite than “deep.”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now, I went on, each single opposite has but one opposite,
      </p>

      <p>
        not many?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted this.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Come now, I said, let us reckon up our points of agreement. We have
        agreed that one thing has but one opposite, and no more?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We have.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And that what is done in an opposite way is done by opposites?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And we have agreed that what is done foolishly is done in an opposite
        way to what is done temperately?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And that what is done temperately is done by temperance, and what
        foolishly by folly?
      </p>

      <p>
        He assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now if it is done in an opposite way, it must be done by an opposite?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And one is done by temperance, and the other by folly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In an opposite way?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And by opposite faculties?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then folly is opposite to temperance
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now do you recollect that in the previous stage we have agreed that
        folly is opposite to wisdom?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted this.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And that one thing has but one opposite?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then which, Protagoras, of our propositions are we to reject—the
        statement that one thing has but one opposite; or the other, that wisdom
        is different from temperance, and each is a part of virtue, and
        moreover, a different part, and that the two are as unlike, both in
        themselves and in their faculties, as the parts of the face? Which are
        we to upset? The two of them together are not quite in tune; they do not
        chime in harmony. How could they,
      </p>

      <p>
        if one thing must needs have but one opposite and no more, while wisdom,
        and temperance likewise, appear both to be opposite to folly, which is a
        single thing? Such is the position, Protagoras, I said or is it
        otherwise?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted it was so, much against his will.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then temperance and wisdom must be one thing? And indeed we found before
        that justice and holiness were almost the same thing. Come, Protagoras,
        I said, let us not falter, but carry out our inquiry to the end. Tell
        me, does a man who acts unjustly seem to you to be temperate
      </p>

      <p>
        in so acting?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I should be ashamed, Socrates, he replied, to admit that, in spite of
        what many people say.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then shall I address my argument to them, I asked, or to you?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        If you please, he answered, debate first against that popular theory.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It is all the same to me, I said, so long as you make answer, whether it
        be your own opinion or not. For although my first object is to test the
        argument, the result perhaps will be that both I, the questioner, and my
        respondent are brought to the test.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first Protagoras appeared to be coy, alleging that the argument was
        too disconcerting: however he consented at length to make answer. Well
        now, I said, begin at the beginning, and tell me, do you consider people
        to be temperate when they are unjust?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Let us suppose so, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And by being temperate you mean being sensible?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And being sensible is being well-advised in their injustice?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Let us grant it, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Does this mean, I asked, if they fare well by their injustice, or if
        they fare ill?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        If they fare well.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now do you say there are things that are good?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then, I asked, are those things good which are profitable to men?
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh yes, to be sure, he replied, and also when they are not profitable to
        men I call them good.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here Protagoras seemed to me to be in a thoroughly provoked and harassed
        state, and to have set his face against answering: so when I saw him in
        this mood I grew wary and went gently with my questions. Do you mean,
        Protagoras, I asked,
      </p>

      <p>
        things that are profitable to no human being, or things not profitable
        in any way at all? Can you call such things as these good?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means, he replied; but I know a number of things that are
        unprofitable to men, namely, foods, drinks, drugs, and countless others,
        and some that are profitable; some that are neither one nor the other to
        men, but are one or the other to horses; and some that are profitable
        only to cattle, or again to dogs; some also that are not profitable to
        any of those, but are to trees; and some that are good for the roots of
        a tree, but bad for its shoots—such as dung,
      </p>

      <p>
        which is a good thing when applied to the roots of all plants, whereas
        if you chose to cast it on the young twigs and branches, it will ruin
        all. And oil too is utterly bad for all plants, and most deadly for the
        hair of all animals save that of man, while to the hair of man it is
        helpful, as also to the rest of his body. The good is such an elusive
        and diverse thing that in this instance it is good for the outward parts
        of man's body,
      </p>

      <p>
        but at the same time as bad as can be for the inward; and for this
        reason all doctors forbid the sick to take oil, except the smallest
        possible quantity, in what one is going to eat—just enough to quench the
        loathing that arises in the sensations of one's nostrils from food and
        its dressings.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When he had thus spoken, the company acclaimed it as an excellent
        answer; and then I remarked: Protagoras, I find I am a forgetful sort of
        person,
      </p>

      <p>
        and if someone addresses me at any length I forget the subject on which
        he is talking. So, just as you, in entering on a discussion with me,
        would think fit to speak louder to me than to others if I happened to be
        hard of hearing, please bear in mind now that you have to deal with a
        forgetful person, and therefore cut up your answers into shorter pieces,
        that I may be able to follow you.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, what do you mean by short answers? he asked: do you want me to
        make them shorter than they should be?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not at all, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        As long as they should be? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then are my answers to be as long as I think they should be, or as you
        think they should be?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, for instance, I have heard, I said, that you yourself are able, in
        treating one and the same subject, not only to instruct another person
        in it but to speak on it at length, if you choose, without ever being at
        a loss for matter; or again briefly,
      </p>

      <p>
        so as to yield to no one in brevity of expression. So, if you are going
        to argue with me, employ with me the latter method, that of brevity.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Socrates, he said, I have undertaken in my time many contests of speech,
        and if I were to do what you demand, and argue just in the way that my
        opponent demanded, I should not be held superior to anyone nor would
        Protagoras have made a name among the Greeks.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then, as I saw that he had not been quite satisfied with himself in
        making his former answers, and that he would not readily
      </p>

      <p>
        accept the part of answerer in debate, I considered it was not my
        business to attend his meetings further, and remarked: But you know,
        Protagoras, I too feel uncomfortable about our having this discussion
        against your inclination; but when you agree to argue in such a way that
        I can follow, then I will argue with you. For you—as people relate of
        you, and you yourself assert—are able to hold a discussion in the form
        of either long or short speeches; you are a man of knowledge:
      </p>

      <p>
        but I have no ability for these long speeches, though I could wish that
        I had it. Surely you, who are proficient in both ways, ought to have
        made us this concession, that so we might have had our debate. But now
        that you refuse, and I am somewhat pressed for time and could not stay
        to hear you expatiate at any length—for I have an appointment—I will be
        off; though I daresay I should be happy enough to hear your views.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        With these words I rose as if to go away; but, as I was getting up,
      </p>

      <p>
        Callias laid hold of my arm with his right hand, and grasped this cloak
        of mine with his left, and said: We will not let you go, Socrates; for
        if you leave us our discussions will not go so well. I beg you therefore
        to stay with us, for there is nothing I would rather hear than an
        argument between you and Protagoras. Come, you must oblige us all.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then I said (I was now standing up as though to go out): Son of
        Hipponicus, I always admire your love of knowledge, but especially do I
        commend and love it now,
      </p>

      <p>
        so that I should be very glad to oblige you if you asked of me something
        that I could do: but I am afraid it is as though you asked me to keep
        pace with Criso the runner of Himera in his prime, or to keep up in a
        match with one of the long-distance or day-course racers, and I could
        only tell you that
      </p>

      <p>
        I wish that of myself, without your asking, I could keep pace with such
        runners, but of course I cannot. If you want to have the spectacle of
        Criso and me running together, you must ask him to adapt his pace; for
        whereas I cannot run fast, he can run slowly. So if you desire to hear
        Protagoras and me, ask him to resume the method of answering which he
        used at first—in short sentences and keeping to the point raised.
        Otherwise
      </p>

      <p>
        what is to be our mode of discussion? For I thought that to hold a joint
        discussion and to make a harangue were two distinct things.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Ah, but you see, Socrates, he said, Protagoras thinks it only fair to
        claim that he be allowed to discuss in his chosen style, in return for
        your claim that it should be in yours.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this Alcibiades intervened, saying: You do not state it quite
        philosophically, Callias, for Socrates here confesses he is no hand at
        long discourses, and yields therein to Protagoras;
      </p>

      <p>
        but I should be surprised if he yields to any man in ability to argue,
        or in understanding the interchange of reason. Now if Protagoras
        confesses himself inferior to Socrates in argumentation, Socrates has no
        more to ask: but if he challenges him, let him discuss by question and
        answer; not spinning out a lecture on each question—beating off the
        arguments, refusing to give a reason, and so dilating
      </p>

      <p>
        until most of his hearers have forgotten the point at issue. For
        Socrates, I warrant you, will not forget, despite his jesting way of
        calling himself forgetful. Now I think Socrates' proposal is the more
        equitable—for each of us should declare his personal opinion.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        After Alcibiades, the next, I believe, to speak was Critias: Prodicus
        and Hippias, he said, it seems to me that Callias is all for supporting
        Protagoras, while Alcibiades is always for a contest
      </p>

      <p>
        in anything he takes up. It is not for us to contend on either side for
        Socrates or for Protagoras, but jointly to request them both not to
        break off
      </p>

      <p>
        our conference unconcluded.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When he had said this, Prodicus remarked: I think you are right,
        Critias: those who attend this sort of discussion ought to be joint, but
        not equal, hearers of both disputants. For there is a difference: we
        should listen jointly to them both, yet not give equal heed to each, but
        more to the wiser and less to the less intelligent. I on my part also,
        Protagoras and Socrates, call upon you to accede to our request, and to
        dispute,
      </p>

      <p>
        but not wrangle, with each other over your arguments: for friends
        dispute with friends, just from good feeling; whereas wrangling is
        between those who are at variance and enmity with one another. In this
        way our meeting will have highest success, since you the speakers will
        thus earn the greatest measure of good repute, not praise, from us who
        hear you. For good repute is present in the hearers' souls without
        deception, but praise is too often in the words of liars who hide what
        they really think.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, we listeners would thus be most comforted, not pleased; for he is
        comforted who learns something and gets a share of good sense in his
        mind alone, whereas he is pleased who eats something or has some other
        pleasant sensation only in his body.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When Prodicus had thus spoken, quite a number of the company showed
        their approval then after Prodicus the learned Hippias spoke: Gentlemen,
        he said, who are here present, I regard you all as kinsmen and intimates
        and fellow-citizens by nature, not by law:
      </p>

      <p>
        for like is akin to like by nature, whereas law, despot of mankind,
        often constrains us against nature. Hence it would be shameful if we,
        while knowing the nature of things, should yet—being the wisest of the
        Greeks, and having met together for the very purpose in the very
        sanctuary of the wisdom of Greece, and in this the greatest and most
        auspicious house of the city of cities—display no worthy sign of this
        dignity,
      </p>

      <p>
        but should quarrel with each other like low churls. Now let me beg and
        advise you, Protagoras and Socrates, to come to terms arranged, as it
        were, under our arbitration: you, Socrates, must, not require that
        precise form
      </p>

      <p>
        of discussion with its extreme brevity, if it is disagreeable to
        Protagoras, but let the speeches have their head with a loose rein, that
        they may give us a more splendid and elegant impression; nor must you,
        Protagoras, let out full sail, as you run before the breeze, and so
        escape into the ocean of speech leaving the land nowhere in sight;
        rather, both of you must take a middle course. So you shall do as I say,
        and I strongly urge you to choose an umpire or supervisor or chairman
      </p>

      <p>
        who will keep watch for you over the due measure of either's speeches.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        His proposal was approved by the company, and they all applauded it:
        Callias said he would not let me go, and they requested me to choose a
        supervisor. To this I replied that it would be a shame to choose an
        arbiter for our discussion; for if he who is chosen, said I, is to be
        our inferior, it would not be right to have the inferior overseeing the
        superior; while if he is our equal, that will be just as wrong, for our
        equal will only do very much as we do, and it will be superfluous to
        choose him.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may say you will choose one who is our superior. This, in very
        truth, I hold to be impossible—to choose someone who is wiser than our
        friend Protagoras; and if you choose one who is not his superior, though
        you may say he is, that again would cast a slur on him, as if he were
        some paltry fellow requiring a supervisor; for, as far as I am
        concerned, the matter is indifferent. But let me tell you how I would
        have the thing done, so that your eagerness for a conference and a
        discussion may be satisfied. If Protagoras does not wish to answer,
      </p>

      <p>
        let him ask questions, and I will answer: at the same time I will try to
        show him how the answerer, in my view, ought to answer; and when I have
        answered all the questions that he wishes to ask, in his turn he shall
        render account in like manner to me. So if he does not seem very ready
        to answer the particular question put to him, you and I will join in
        beseeching him, as you have besought me, not to upset our conference.
        And for this plan there is no need to have one man as supervisor;
      </p>

      <p>
        you will all supervise it together.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They all resolved that it should be done in this way: Protagoras, though
        very unwilling, was obliged after all to agree to ask questions and
        then, when he had asked a sufficient number, to take his turn at making
        due response in short answers.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And so he began to put questions in this sort of way: I consider,
        Socrates, that the greatest part
      </p>

      <p>
        of a man's education is to be skilled in the matter of verses; that is,
        to be able to apprehend, in the utterances of the poets, what has been
        rightly and what wrongly composed, and to know how to distinguish them
        and account for them when questioned. Accordingly my question now will
        be on the same subject that you and I are now debating, namely virtue,
        but taken in connexion with poetry: that will be the only difference.
        Now, Simonides, I think, somewhere remarks to Scopas, the son of Creon
        of Thessaly—
      </p>

      <p>
        “For a man, indeed, to become good truly is hard, In hands and feet and
        mind foursquare, Fashioned without reproach.” Do you know the ode, or
        shall I recite the whole?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To this I replied: There is no need, for I know it it happens that I
        have especially studied that ode.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I am glad to hear it, he said. Now do you regard it as finely and
        correctly composed or not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Very finely and correctly, I replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And do you regard it as finely composed, if the poet contradicts
        himself?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, I replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then observe it more closely, he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        My good sir, I have given it ample attention.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Are you aware, then, he asked, that as the ode proceeds he says at one
        point— “Nor ringeth true to me That word of Pittacus— And yet 'twas a
        sage who spake—Hard, quoth he, to be good.” Do you note that this and
        the former are statements of the same person?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I know that, I said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you think the second agrees with the first?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So far as I can see, it does, I replied (at the same time, though, I was
        afraid there was something in what he said). Why, I asked, does it not
        seem so to you?
      </p>

      <p>
        How can anyone, he replied, be thought consistent, who says both of
        these things? First he laid it down himself that it is hard for a man to
        become good in truth, and then a little further on in his poem he
        forgot, and he proceeds to blame Pittacus for saying the same as he
        did—that it is hard to be good, and refuses to accept from him the same
        statement that he made himself. Yet, as often as he blames the man for
        saying the same as himself he obviously blames himself too, so that in
        either the former or the latter place his statement is wrong.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        This speech of his won a clamorous approval
      </p>

      <p>
        from many of his hearers; and at first I felt as though I had been
        struck by a skilful boxer, and was quite blind and dizzy with the effect
        of his words and the noise of their applause. Then—to tell you the
        honest truth—in order to gain time for considering the poet's meaning, I
        turned to Prodicus and calling him—Prodicus, I said, surely Simonides
        was your townsman: it behoves you to come to the man's rescue.
        Accordingly I allow myself to call for your assistance—
      </p>

      <p>
        just as Scamander, in Homer, when besieged by Achilles, called Simois to
        his aid, saying— “Dear brother, let us both together stay this warriors
        might.”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In the same way I call upon you, lest Protagoras lay Simonides in ruins.
        For indeed to rehabilitate Simonides requires your artistry,
      </p>

      <p>
        by which you can discriminate between wishing and desiring as two
        distinct things in the fine and ample manner of your statement just now.
        So please consider if you agree with my view. For it is not clear that
        Simonides does contradict himself. Now you, Prodicus, shall declare your
        verdict first: do you consider becoming and being to be the same or
        different?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Different, to be sure, said Prodicus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now in the first passage, I said, Simonides gave it as his own opinion
        that it is hard for a man
      </p>

      <p>
        to become good in truth.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite true, said Prodicus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And he blames Pittacus, I went on, for saying not, as Protagoras holds,
        the same as himself, but something different. For what Pittacus said was
        not, as Simonides said, that it is hard “to become” but “to be” good.
        Now being and becoming, Protagoras, as our friend Prodicus says, are not
        the same thing; and if being and becoming are not the same thing,
        Simonides does not contradict himself. Perhaps Prodicus
      </p>

      <p>
        and many others might say with Hesiod that to become good is hard,
        &ldquo;for Heaven hath set hard travail on the way to virtue; and when
        one reacheth the summit thereof, 'tis an easy thing to possess, though
        hard before.&rdquo;
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When Prodicus heard this he gave me his approval: but Protagoras
        observed: Your correction, Socrates, contains an error greater than that
        which you are correcting.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To which I answered: then it is a bad piece of work I have done, it
        would seem, Protagoras, and I am an absurd sort of physician;
      </p>

      <p>
        my treatment increases the malady.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Just so, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How is that? I asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Great, he replied, would be the ignorance of the poet, if he calls it
        such a slight matter to possess virtue, which is the hardest thing in
        the world, as all men agree.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then I remarked: Upon my word, how opportunely it has happened that
        Prodicus is here to join in our discussion! For it is very likely,
        Protagoras, that Prodicus' wisdom is a gift of long ago from heaven,
      </p>

      <p>
        beginning either in the time of Simonides or even earlier. But you, so
        skilled in many other things, appear to be unskilled in this, and lack
        the skill that I can boast because I am a disciple of the great
        Prodicus; and so now I find you do not understand that perhaps Simonides
        did not conceive “hard” in the way that you conceive it—just as, in the
        case of “awful,” Prodicus here corrects me each time I use the word in
        praising you or someone else; when I say, for instance, that
      </p>

      <p>
        Protagoras is an awfully wise man, he asks if I am not ashamed to call
        good things awful. For awful, he says, is bad; thus no one on this or
        that occasion speaks of “awful wealth” or “awful peace” or “awful
        health,” but we say “awful disease,” “awful war” or “awful poverty,”
        taking “awful” to be “bad.” So perhaps “hard” also was intended by the
        Ceans and Simonides as either “bad” or something else that you do not
        understand: let us therefore ask Prodicus, for it is fair to question
        him on the dialect of Simonides.
      </p>

      <p>
        What did Simonides mean, Prodicus, by “hard”?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        “Bad,” he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then it is on this account, Prodicus, I said, that he blames Pittacus
        for saying it is hard to be good, just as though he heard him say it is
        bad to be good.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, Socrates, he said, what else do you think Simonides meant? Was he
        not reproaching Pittacus for not knowing how to distinguish words
        correctly, Lesbian as he was, and nurtured in a foreign tongue?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You hear, Protagoras, I said,
      </p>

      <p>
        what Prodicus here suggests: have you anything to say upon it?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        The case, said Protagoras, is far otherwise, Prodicus: I am quite sure
        that Simonides meant by “hard” the same as we generally do—not “bad,”
        but whatever is not easy and involves a great amount of trouble.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Ah, I agree with you, Protagoras, I said, that this is Simonides'
        meaning, and that our friend Prodicus knows it, but is joking and
        chooses to experiment on you to see if you will be able to support your
        own statement. For that Simonides does not mean
      </p>

      <p>
        that “hard” is “bad” we have clear proof forthwith in the next phrase,
        where he says— “God alone can have this privilege.” Surely he cannot
        mean that it is bad to be good, if he proceeds here to say that God
        alone can have this thing, and attributes this privilege to God only;
        otherwise Prodicus would call Simonides a rake, and no true Cean. But I
        should like to tell you what I take to be Simonides' intention in this
        ode, if you care to test my powers,
      </p>

      <p>
        as you put it, in the matter of verses; though if you would rather, I
        will hear your account.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        When Protagoras heard me say this—As you please, Socrates, he said; then
        Prodicus and Hippias strongly urged me, and the rest of them also.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, I said, I will try to explain to you my own feeling about
        this poem. Now philosophy is of more ancient and abundant growth in
        Crete and Lacedaemon than in any other part of Greece,
      </p>

      <p>
        and sophists are more numerous in those regions: but the people there
        deny it and make pretence of ignorance, in order to prevent the
        discovery that it is by wisdom that they have ascendancy over the rest
        of the Greeks, like those sophists of whom Protagoras was speaking ;
        they prefer it to be thought that they owe their superiority to fighting
        and valor, conceiving that the revelation of its real cause would lead
        everyone to practise this wisdom. So well have they kept their secret
        that they have deceived the followers of the Spartan cult in our cities,
        with the result that some get broken ears
      </p>

      <p>
        by imitating them, bind their knuckles with thongs, go in for muscular
        exercises, and wear dashing little cloaks, as though it were by these
        means that the Spartans were the masters of Greece. And when the
        Spartans wish to converse unrestrainedly with their sophists, and begin
        to chafe at the secrecy of their meetings, they pass alien acts against
        the laconizing set and any other strangers within their gates, and have
        meetings with the sophists unknown to the foreigners; while on their
        part they do not permit any of their young men
      </p>

      <p>
        to travel abroad to the other cities—in this rule they resemble the
        Cretans—lest they unlearn what they are taught at home. In those two
        states there are not only men but women also who pride themselves on
        their education; and you can tell that what I say is true and that the
        Spartans have the best education in philosophy and argument by this: if
        you choose to consort with the meanest of Spartans,
      </p>

      <p>
        at first you will find him making a poor show in the conversation; but
        soon, at some point or other in the discussion, he gets home with a
        notable remark, short and compressed—a deadly shot that makes his
        interlocutor seem like a helpless child. Hence this very truth has been
        observed by certain persons both in our day and in former times—that the
        Spartan cult is much more the pursuit of wisdom than of athletics; for
        they know that a man's ability
      </p>

      <p>
        to utter such remarks is to be ascribed to his perfect education. Such
        men were Thales of Miletus, Pittacus of Mytilene, Bias of Priene, Solon
        of our city, Cleobulus of Lindus, Myson of Chen, and, last of the
        traditional seven, Chilon of Sparta. All these were enthusiasts, lovers
        and disciples of the Spartan culture; and you can recognize that
        character in their wisdom by the short, memorable sayings that fell from
        each of them they assembled together
      </p>

      <p>
        and dedicated these as the first-fruits of their lore to Apollo in his
        Delphic temple, inscribing there those maxims which are on every
        tongue—“Know thyself” and “Nothing overmuch.” To what intent do I say
        this? To show how the ancient philosophy had this style of laconic
        brevity; and so it was that the saying of Pittacus was privately handed
        about with high approbation among the sages—that it is hard to be good.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then Simonides, ambitious to get a name for wisdom, perceived that if he
        could overthrow this saying, as one might some famous athlete, and
        become its conqueror, he would win fame himself amongst men of that day.
        Accordingly it was against this saying, and with this aim, that he
        composed the whole poem as a means of covertly assailing and abasing
        this maxim, as it seems to me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now let us all combine in considering whether my account is really true.
        The opening of the ode must at once appear crazy if, while intending to
        say that
      </p>

      <p>
        it is hard for a man to become good, he inserted “indeed.” There is no
        sort of sense, I imagine, in this insertion, unless we suppose that
        Simonides is addressing himself to the saying of Pittacus as a
        disputant: Pittacus says—It is hard to be good; and the poet controverts
        this by observing—No, but to become good, indeed, is hard for a man,
        Pittacus, truly—not truly good; he does not mention truth in this
        connexion,
      </p>

      <p>
        or imply that some things are truly good, while others are good but not
        truly so: this would seem silly and unlike Simonides. We must rather
        take the “truly” as a poetical transposition, and first quote the saying
        of Pittacus in some such way as this: let us suppose Pittacus himself to
        be speaking and Simonides replying, as thus—Good people, he says, it is
        hard to be good; and the poet answers—Pittacus,
      </p>

      <p>
        what you say is not true, for it is not being but becoming good,
        indeed—in hands and feet and mind foursquare, fashioned without
        reproach—that is truly hard. In this way we see a purpose in the
        insertion of “indeed,” and that the “truly” is correctly placed at the
        end; and all that comes after corroborates this view of his meaning.
        There are many points in the various expressions of the poem
      </p>

      <p>
        which might be instanced to show its fine composition, for it is a work
        of very elegant and elaborate art; but it would take too long to detail
        all its beauties. However, let us go over its general outline and
        intention, which is assuredly to refute Pittacus' saying, throughout the
        ode.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Proceeding a little way on from our passage, just as though he were
        making a speech, he says to become, indeed, a good man is truly hard
        (not but what it is possible for a certain space of time); “but to
        continue in this state of what one has become,
      </p>

      <p>
        and to be a good man is, as you say, Pittacus, impossible, superhuman:
        God alone can have this privilege— “For that man cannot help but be bad
        Whom irresistible mischance has overthrown.” Now who is it that an
        irresistible mischance overthrows in the command of a ship? Clearly not
        the ordinary man, for he may be overcome at any time; just as you cannot
        knock over one who is lying down, but one who is standing; you might
        knock over a standing man so as to make him lie down,
      </p>

      <p>
        not one who is lying down already. So it is a man apt to resist that an
        irresistible mischance would overthrow, and not one who could never
        resist anything. A great storm breaking over a steersman will render him
        helpless, and a severe season will leave a farmer helpless, and a doctor
        will be in the same case. For the good has the capacity of becoming bad,
        as we have witness in another poet who said— “Nay more, the virtuous man
        is at one time bad, at another good.” whereas the bad man has no
        capacity for becoming, but must ever be, what he is;
      </p>

      <p>
        so that when an irresistible mischance overthrows him who is
        resourceful, wise, and good, he cannot but be bad; and you say,
        Pittacus, that it is hard to be good—that is, to become good, indeed, is
        hard, though possible, but to be good is impossible: for— “If he hath
        fared well, every man is good; Bad, if ill.” Now what is good faring in
        letters—the thing
      </p>

      <p>
        that makes a man good at them? Clearly, the study of letters. What
        welfare makes a good doctor? Clearly, the study of the cure of the
        ailing. “Bad, if ill”: who could become a bad doctor? Clearly, he who in
        the first place is a doctor, and in the second, a good doctor; for he
        could become a bad one also: whereas we, who are laymen in respect of
        medicine, could never by faring ill become either doctors or joiners or
        anything else of that sort;
      </p>

      <p>
        and if one cannot become a doctor by faring ill, clearly one cannot
        become a bad one either. In the same way the good man may one day become
        bad through the effect either of time or work or illness or some other
        accident; for there is only one sort of ill fare—the deprivation of
        knowledge. But the bad man can never become bad: he is that always. If
        he is to become bad, he must previously become good. Hence the upshot of
        this part of the poem
      </p>

      <p>
        is that it is impossible to be a good man, continuing to be good, but
        possible to become good, and bad also, in the case of the same person.
        And then— &ldquo;Best also for the longest space are they whom the gods
        love.&rdquo; All this has been said with reference to Pittacus, as is
        made still plainer by the ensuing verses, in which he says— “Therefore
        never shall I, in quest of what cannot come to pass, vainly cast my
        life's lot upon a hope impracticable—of finding a man wholly blameless
        amongst us who partake of the fruit of the broad-based earth. If I light
        upon him, be sure I will report it—” says he;
      </p>

      <p>
        and in this vehement tone he pursues the saying of Pittacus all through
        the poem: “But I praise and love everyone willingly committing no
        baseness; for against necessity not even the gods make war.” This also
        is spoken with the same intent. For Simonides was not so ill-educated as
        to say that he praised a person who willingly did no evil, as though
        there were some who did evil willingly. I am fairly sure of this—that
        none of the wise men considers that anybody ever willingly errs
      </p>

      <p>
        or willingly does base and evil deeds; they are well aware that all who
        do base and evil things do them unwillingly; and so Simonides does not
        say he gives his praise to the person who willingly does no evil, but
        uses the word “willingly” of himself. For he considered that a man of
        sense and honor often constrains himself
      </p>

      <p>
        to become a friend and approver of some person, as when a man chances to
        have an uncongenial mother or father or country or other such connexion.
        Now when this sort of thing befalls the wicked, they seem glad to see
        their parents' or country's faults, and complainingly point them out and
        inveigh against them, in order that their own neglect of them may not be
        denounced by their neighbors, who might otherwise reproach them for
        being so neglectful; and hence they multiply
      </p>

      <p>
        their complaints and add voluntary to unavoidable feuds. But good men,
        he knew, conceal the trouble and constrain themselves to praise, and if
        they have any reason to be angered against their parents or country for
        some wrong done to them they pacify and conciliate their feelings,
        compelling themselves to love and praise their own people. And many a
        time, I think, Simonides was conscious that he had praised and eulogized
        some tyrant or other such person, not willingly,
      </p>

      <p>
        but under compulsion. So he proceeds to tell Pittacus—I, Pittacus, do
        not reproach you merely because I am apt to reproach, since— “For my
        part I am content with whosoever is not evil or too intractable. He who
        knows Right, the support of a city, is a healthy man; him I shall never
        blame,” for to blame I am not apt. “Infinite is the race of fools.” “”
        By this he does not mean to say, as it were, that all things are white
      </p>

      <p>
        that have no admixture of black; that would be ridiculous in many ways;
        but that he himself accepts the average sort without reproaching them.
        “I do not seek,” said he, “a man wholly blameless amongst us who partake
        of the fruit of the broad-based earth: if I light upon him, be sure I
        will report it”—meaning, “If I wait for that, I shall never find anyone
        to praise. No, I am content if a man be average and do nothing evil,
        since I love and praise all”—and there he has used a Mytilenaean word,
        for his
      </p>

      <p>
        “I praise and love all willingly” is addressed to Pittacus (here at
        “willingly” one should make a pause);—“all who commit nothing base, but
        some there are whom I praise and love unwillingly. Hence I should never
        reproach you, Pittacus, if you would only speak what is moderately
        reasonable and true.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as it is, since you lie so grievously about the greatest matters
        with an air of speaking the truth, on this score I reproach you.”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Such is my view, Prodicus and Protagoras, I said, of Simonides'
        intention in composing this ode.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Hippias remarked: It certainly seems to me, Socrates, that you have
        given a good exposition of the poem: but I also have an elegant
        discourse upon it,
      </p>

      <p>
        which I will perform for you if you wish.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, Hippias, said Alcibiades, but some other time: for the moment the
        proper thing, according to the agreement which Protagoras and Socrates
        made between them, will be for Socrates to answer any questions that
        Protagoras may still wish to put to him, but if he prefers to answer
        Socrates, then it will be for Socrates to ask.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        On this I remarked: For my part I place it in Protagoras's hands to do
        whichever he likes best.
      </p>

      <p>
        But if he does not mind, let us talk no more of poems and verses, but
        consider the points on which I questioned you at first, Protagoras, and
        on which I should be glad to reach, with your help, a conclusion. For it
        seems to me that arguing about poetry is comparable to the wine-parties
        of common market-folk. These people, owing to their inability to carry
        on a familiar conversation over their wine by means of their own voices
        and discussions—
      </p>

      <p>
        such is their lack of education—put a premium on flute-girls by hiring
        the extraneous voice of the flute at a high price, and carry on their
        intercourse by means of its utterance. But where the party consists of
        thorough gentlemen who have had a proper education, you will see neither
        flute-girls nor dancing-girls nor harp-girls, but only the company
        contenting themselves with their own conversation, and none of these
        fooleries and frolics—each speaking and listening decently in his turn,
      </p>

      <p>
        even though they may drink a great deal of wine. And so a gathering like
        this of ours, when it includes such men as most of us claim to be,
        requires no extraneous voices, not even of the poets, whom one cannot
        question on the sense of what they say; when they are adduced in
        discussion we are generally told by some that the poet thought so and
        so, and by others, something different, and they go on arguing about a
        matter which they are powerless to determine. No, this sort of meeting
        is avoided by men of culture,
      </p>

      <p>
        who prefer to converse directly with each other, and to use their own
        way of speech in putting one another by turns to the test. It is this
        sort of person that I think you and I ought rather to imitate; putting
        the poets aside, let us hold our discussion together in our own persons,
        making trial of the truth and of ourselves. So if you wish to question
        me further, I am at your service as answerer; but if you like, put
        yourself at my service, so that we may clear up the several points of
        the inquiry in which we stopped half-way.
      </p>

      <p>
        On my saying this and something more of the sort, Protagoras gave no
        indication as to which course he would take. So Alcibiades, looking at
        Callias, said: Do you consider, Callias, that Protagoras is behaving
        properly now in refusing to signify whether he will or will not answer?
        I do not think he is. Let him either debate or say that he does not want
        to debate, so that we may have this understanding with him; then
        Socrates can debate with someone else, or another of us with some other,
      </p>

      <p>
        as may be agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Protagoras was ashamed, as it seemed to me, at these words of
        Alcibiades, and the more so when Callias requested him, together with
        almost the whole of the company; and so he reluctantly prevailed on
        himself to take up the debate, and asked to have questions put to him,
        since he was ready to answer.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So I proceeded to say—Protagoras, do not suppose that I have any other
        desire in debating with you than to examine the difficulties which occur
        to myself at each point. For I hold that there is a good deal in what
        Homer says—
      </p>

      <p>
        “When two go together, one observes before the other;”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        for somehow it makes all of us human beings more resourceful in every
        deed or word or thought; but if one observes something alone, forthwith
        one has to go about searching until one discovers somebody to whom one
        can show it off and who can corroborate it. And I also have my reason
        for being glad to debate with you rather than with anyone else; it is
        that I regard you as the best person to investigate in general any
        matters
      </p>

      <p>
        that a sensible man may be expected to examine, and virtue in
        particular. Whom else should I choose but you? Not only do you consider
        yourself a worthy gentleman, like sundry other people, who are sensible
        enough themselves, but cannot make others so; but you are both good
        yourself and have the gift of making others good. And you are so
        confident of yourself that, while others make a secret of this art, you
        have had yourself
      </p>

      <p>
        publicly proclaimed to all the Greeks with the title of sophist, and
        have appointed yourself preceptor of culture and virtue, and are the
        first who has ever demanded a regular fee for such work. What then could
        I do but call upon you to deal with our problem both by question and
        communication? I had no other course. So now with regard to those points
        which I have raised on the subject in my opening questions, I desire to
        be reminded of some
      </p>

      <p>
        by you and to have your help in investigating others. The question, I
        believe, was this: Are the five names of wisdom, temperance, courage,
        justice, and holiness attached to one thing, or underlying each of these
        names is there a distinct existence or thing that has its own particular
        function, each thing being different from the others? And your answer
        was that they are not names attached to one thing,
      </p>

      <p>
        but that each of these names applies to a distinct thing, and that all
        these are parts of virtue; not like the parts of gold, which are similar
        to each other and to the whole of which they are parts, but like the
        parts of the face, dissimilar to the whole of which they are parts and
        to each other, and each having a distinct function. If you still hold
        the same opinion of them, say so; if you have a new one, define what it
        is, for I make no objection to your replying now on other lines. Indeed
        I should not be surprised
      </p>

      <p>
        if you were merely experimenting upon me when you spoke before.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, Socrates, he replied, I say that all these are parts of virtue,
        and that while four of them are fairly on a par with each other, courage
        is something vastly different from all the rest. You may perceive the
        truth of what I say from this: you will find many people extremely
        unjust, unholy, dissolute, and ignorant, and yet pre-eminently
        courageous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stop now, I said: we must duly examine what you say. Do you call
        courageous men bold, or something else?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, and impetuous also, he replied, where most men fear to tread.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, do you say that virtue is a good thing, and of this good thing
        offer yourself as teacher?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nay, it is the best of things, he said, unless I am out of my senses.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then is one part of it base and another good, or is the whole good?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Surely the whole is good in the highest possible degree.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now do you know who
      </p>

      <p>
        dive boldly into wells?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do; divers.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Is this because they have knowledge, or for some other reason?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Because they have knowledge.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And who are bold in going to war on horseback—those who are practised
        horsemen, or those who are not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Practised horsemen.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And who with bucklers—buckler-men, or those who are not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Buckler-men: and so with all other cases, he went on, if that is your
        point; those who have knowledge are bolder than those who lack it, and
        individually they are bolder when they have learnt
      </p>

      <p>
        than before learning.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But you must have seen at times, I said, persons who are without
        knowledge of any of these affairs, yet behaving boldly in each of them.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I have, he said, and very boldly too.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then are these bold ones courageous also?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nay, that would make courage a base thing, he replied; for those you
        speak of are out of their senses.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What then, I asked, do you mean by courageous men? Surely the same as
        bold men?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, I do still, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then these men, I went on, who are so brave, are found to be not
        courageous but mad? And in those former cases our wisest men are boldest
        too, and being boldest are most courageous? And on this reasoning,
        wisdom will be courage?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You do not rightly recall, Socrates, what I stated in replying to you.
        When you asked me whether courageous men are bold, I admitted it: I was
        not asked whether bold men are courageous. Had you asked me this before,
        I should have said—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not all.” And as to proving that courageous men are not bold, you have
        nowhere pointed out that I was wrong in my admission that they are. Next
        you show that such persons individually are bolder when they have
        knowledge, and bolder than others who lack it, and therewith you take
        courage and wisdom to be the same: proceeding in this manner you might
        even take strength to be wisdom. On this method you might begin by
        asking me whether the strong are powerful, and I should say “Yes”;
      </p>

      <p>
        and then, whether those who know how to wrestle are more powerful than
        those who do not know how to wrestle, and whether individually they are
        more powerful when they have learnt than before learning, and I should
        say “Yes.” And on my admitting these points it would be open to you to
        say, by the same token, that according to my admission wisdom is
        strength. But neither there nor elsewhere do I admit that the powerful
        are strong, only that the strong are powerful; for I hold that power and
        strength
      </p>

      <p>
        are not the same, but that one of them, power, comes from knowledge, or
        from madness or rage, whereas strength comes from constitution and fit
        nurture of the body. So, in the other instance, boldness and courage are
        not the same, and therefore it results that the courageous are bold, but
        not that the bold are courageous; for boldness comes to a man from art,
        or
      </p>

      <p>
        from rage or madness, like power, whereas courage comes from
        constitution and fit nurture of the soul.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do you speak of some men, Protagoras, I asked, as living well, and
        others ill?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you consider that a man would live well if he lived in distress
        and anguish?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, if he lived pleasantly and so ended his life, would you not
        consider he had thus contrived to live well?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I would, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And, I suppose, to live pleasantly is good,
      </p>

      <p>
        and unpleasantly, bad?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said, if one lived in the enjoyment of honorable things.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But, Protagoras, will you tell me you agree with the majority in calling
        some pleasant things bad and some painful ones good? I mean to say—Are
        not things good in so far as they are pleasant, putting aside any other
        result they may have; and again, are not painful things in just the same
        sense bad—in so far as they are painful?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I cannot tell, Socrates, he replied, whether
        I am to answer, in such absolute fashion as that of your question,
      </p>

      <p>
        that all pleasant things are good and painful things bad: I rather think
        it safer for me to reply, with a view not merely to my present answer
        but to all the rest of my life, that some pleasant things are not good,
        and also that some painful things are not bad, and some are, while a
        third class of them are indifferent—neither bad nor good.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You call pleasant, do you not, I asked, things that partake of pleasure
        or
      </p>

      <p>
        cause pleasure?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So when I put it to you, whether things are not good in so far as they
        are pleasant, I am asking whether pleasure itself is not a good thing.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Let us examine the matter, Socrates, he said, in the form in which you
        put it at each point, and if the proposition seems to be reasonable, and
        pleasant and good are found to be the same, we shall agree upon it; if
        not, we shall dispute it there and then.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And would you like, I asked, to be leader in the inquiry, or am I to
        lead?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You ought to lead, he replied, since you are the inaugurator of this
        discussion.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then,
      </p>

      <p>
        I proceeded, will the following example give us the light we need? Just
        as, in estimating a man's health or bodily efficiency by his appearance,
        one might look at his face and the lower part of his arms and say: Come
        now, uncover your chest too and your back and show them, that I may
        examine you thoroughly—so the same sort of desire comes over me in
        regard to our inquiry. Observing your condition to be as you describe in
        respect of the good and the pleasant, I am fain to say something like
        this: Come, my good Protagoras, uncover some more of your thoughts:
      </p>

      <p>
        how are you in regard to knowledge? Do you share the view that most
        people take of this, or have you some other? The opinion generally held
        of knowledge is something of this sort—that it is no strong or guiding
        or governing thing; it is not regarded as anything of that kind, but
        people think that, while a man often has knowledge in him, he is not
        governed by it, but by something else—now by passion, now by pleasure,
        now by pain, at times by love, and often by fear; their feeling about
        knowledge
      </p>

      <p>
        is just what they have about a slave, that it may be dragged about by
        any other force. Now do you agree with this view of it, or do you
        consider that knowledge is something noble and able to govern man, and
        that whoever learns what is good and what is bad will never be swayed by
        anything to act otherwise than as knowledge bids, and that intelligence
        is a sufficient succor for mankind?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        My view, Socrates, he replied, is precisely that which you express,
      </p>

      <p>
        and what is more, it would be a disgrace for me above all men to assert
        that wisdom and knowledge were aught but the highest of all human
        things.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well and truly spoken, I said. Now you know that most people will not
        listen to you and me, but say that many, while knowing what is best,
        refuse to perform it, though they have the power, and do other things
        instead. And whenever I have asked them to tell me what can be the
        reason of this, they say that those who act so are acting under the
        influence of pleasure or pain,
      </p>

      <p>
        or under the control of one of the things I have just mentioned.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, Socrates, he replied, I regard this as but one of the many
        erroneous sayings of mankind.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Come then, and join me in the endeavor to persuade the world and explain
        what is this experience of theirs, which they call “being overcome by
        pleasure,” and which they give as the reason why they fail to do what is
        best though they have knowledge of it. For perhaps if we said to them:
        What you assert, good people, is not correct, but quite untrue—they
        might ask us: Protagoras and Socrates, if this experience is not “being
        overcome by pleasure”
      </p>

      <p>
        what on earth is it, and what do you call it? Tell us that.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, Socrates, must we consider the opinion of the mass of mankind,
      </p>

      <p>
        who say just what occurs to them?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I fancy, I replied, that this will be a step towards discovering how
        courage is related to the other parts of virtue. So if you think fit to
        abide by the arrangement we made a while ago—that I should lead in the
        direction which seems best for elucidating the matter—you must now
        follow; but if you would rather not, to suit your wishes I will let it
        pass.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, he said, your plan is quite right: go on to the end as you began.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once more then, I proceeded, suppose they should ask us: Then what do
        you call this thing which we described as “being overcome by pleasures”?
        The answer I should give them would be this: Please attend; Protagoras
        and I will try to explain it to you. Do you not say that this thing
        occurs, good people, in the common case of a man being overpowered by
        the pleasantness of food or drink or sexual acts, and doing what he does
        though he knows it to be wicked? They would admit it. Then you and I
        would ask them again: In what sense do you call such deeds wicked?
      </p>

      <p>
        Is it that they produce those pleasures and are themselves pleasant at
        the moment, or that later on they cause diseases and poverty, and have
        many more such ills in store for us? Or, even though they have none of
        these things in store for a later day, and cause us only enjoyment,
        would they still be evil just because, forsooth, they cause enjoyment in
        some way or other? Can we suppose, Protagoras, that they will make any
        other answer than that these things are evil, not according to the
        operation of the actual pleasure
      </p>

      <p>
        of the moment, but owing to the later results in disease and those other
        ills?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I think, said Protagoras, that most people would answer thus.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then in causing diseases they cause pains? And in causing poverty they
        cause pains?
      </p>

      <p>
        They would admit this, I imagine.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Protagoras agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then does it seem to you, my friends, as Protagoras and I assert, that
        the only reason why these things are evil is that they end at last in
        pains, and deprive us of other pleasures? Would they admit this?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We both agreed that they would.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then again, suppose we should ask them the opposite: You, sirs, who tell
        us on the other hand that good things are painful—do you not give such
        instances as physical training, military service, and medical treatment
        conducted by cautery, incision, drugs, or starvation, and say that these
        are good, but painful? Would they not grant it?
      </p>

      <p>
        He agreed that they would.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you call them good because they produce extreme pangs and
        anguish for the moment, or because later on they result in health and
        good bodily condition, the deliverance of cities, dominion over others,
        and wealth? They would assent to this, I suppose.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And are these things good for any other reason than that they end at
        last in pleasures and relief and riddance of pains? Or have you some
        other end to mention,
      </p>

      <p>
        with respect to which you call them good, apart from pleasures and
        pains? They could not find one, I fancy.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I too think they could not, said Protagoras.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you pursue pleasure as being a good thing, and shun pain as
        being a bad one?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed that we do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So one thing you hold to be bad—pain; and pleasure you hold to be good,
        since the very act of enjoying you call bad as soon as it deprives us of
        greater pleasures than it has in itself, or leads to greater pains than
        the pleasures it contains.
      </p>

      <p>
        For if it is with reference to something else that you call the act of
        enjoyment bad, and with a view to some other end, you might be able to
        tell it us but this you will be unable to do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I too think that they cannot, said Protagoras.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then is not the same thing repeated in regard to the state of being
        pained? You call being pained a good thing as soon as it either rids us
        of greater pains than those it comprises, or leads to greater pleasures
        than its pains. Now if you have in view some other end
      </p>

      <p>
        than those which I mention when you call being pained good, you can tell
        it us; but you never can.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Truly spoken, said Protagoras.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Once more then, I proceeded; if you were to ask me, my friends, Now why
        on earth do you speak at such length on this point, and in so many ways?
        I should reply, Forgive me: in the first place, it is not easy to
        conclude what it is that you mean when you say “overcome by pleasures”;
        and secondly, on this point hang all our conclusions. But it is still
        quite possible to retract, if you can somehow contrive to say that
      </p>

      <p>
        the good is different from pleasure, or the bad from pain. Is it enough
        for you to live out your life pleasantly, without pain? If it is, and
        you are unable to tell us of any other good or evil that does not end in
        pleasure or pain, listen to what I have to say next. I tell you that if
        this is so, the argument becomes absurd, when you say that it is often
        the case that a man, knowing the evil to be evil, nevertheless commits
        it, when he might avoid it, because he is driven and dazed
      </p>

      <p>
        by his pleasures; while on the other hand you say that a man, knowing
        the good, refuses to do good because of the momentary pleasures by which
        he is overcome.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        The absurdity of all this will be manifest if we refrain from using a
        number of terms at once, such as pleasant, painful, good, and bad; and
        as there appeared to be two things, let us call them by two names—first,
        good and evil, and then later on, pleasant and painful. Let us then lay
        it down as our statement,
      </p>

      <p>
        that a man does evil in spite of knowing the evil of it. Now if someone
        asks us: Why? we shall answer: Because he is overcome. By what? the
        questioner will ask us and this time we shall be unable to reply: By
        pleasure—for this has exchanged its name for “the good.” So we must
        answer only with the words: Because he is overcome. By what? says the
        questioner. The good—must surely be our reply. Now if our questioner
        chance to be an arrogant person he will laugh and exclaim: What a
        ridiculous statement,
      </p>

      <p>
        that a man does evil, knowing it to be evil, and not having to do it,
        because he is overcome by the good! Is this, he will ask, because the
        good is not worthy of conquering the evil in you, or because it is
        worthy?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Clearly we must reply: Because it is not worthy; otherwise he whom we
        speak of as overcome by pleasures would not have offended. But in what
        sense, he might ask us, is the good unworthy of the bad, or the bad of
        the good? This can only be when the one is greater and the other
        smaller, or when there are more on the one side and fewer on the other.
        We shall not find
      </p>

      <p>
        any other reason to give; So it is clear, he will say, that by “being
        overcome” you mean getting the greater evil in exchange for the lesser
        good. That must be agreed. Then let us apply the terms “pleasant” and
        “painful”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        to these things instead, and say that a man does what we previously
        called evil, but now call painful, knowing it to be painful, because he
        is overcome by the pleasant, which is obviously
      </p>

      <p>
        unworthy to conquer. What unworthiness can there be in pleasure as
        against pain, save an excess or defect of one compared with the other?
        That is, when one becomes greater and the other smaller, or when there
        are more on one side and fewer on the other, or here a greater degree
        and there a less. For if you should say: But, Socrates, the immediately
        pleasant differs widely from the subsequently pleasant or painful, I
        should reply: Do they differ in anything but pleasure and pain?
      </p>

      <p>
        That is the only distinction. Like a practised weigher, put pleasant
        things and painful in the scales, and with them the nearness and the
        remoteness, and tell me which count for more. For if you weigh pleasant
        things against pleasant, the greater and the more are always to be
        preferred: if painful against painful, then always the fewer and
        smaller. If you weigh pleasant against painful, and find that the
        painful are outbalanced by the pleasant—whether the near by the remote
        or the remote by the near—you must take that course of action to which
        the pleasant are attached;
      </p>

      <p>
        but not that course if the pleasant are outweighed by the painful. Can
        the case be otherwise, I should ask, than thus, my friends? I am certain
        they could state no alternative.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To this he too assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Since that is the case, then, I shall say, please answer me this: Does
        not the same size appear larger to your sight when near, and smaller
        when distant? They will admit this. And it is the same with thickness
        and number? And sounds of equal strength are greater when near, and
        smaller when distant?
      </p>

      <p>
        They would agree to this. Now if our welfare consisted in doing and
        choosing things of large dimensions, and avoiding and not doing those of
        small, what would be our salvation in life? Would it be the art of
        measurement, or the power of appearance? Is it not the latter that leads
        us astray, as we saw, and many a time causes us to take things
        topsy-turvy and to have to change our minds both in our conduct and in
        our choice of great or small? Whereas the art of measurement would have
        made this appearance ineffective,
      </p>

      <p>
        and by showing us the truth would have brought our soul into the repose
        of abiding by the truth, and so would have saved our life. Would men
        acknowledge, in view of all this, that the art which saves our life is
        measurement, or some other?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It is measurement, he agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, if the saving of our life depended on the choice of odd or
        even, and on knowing when to make a right choice of the greater and when
        of the less—taking each by itself or comparing it with the other, and
        whether near
      </p>

      <p>
        or distant—what would save our life? Would it not be knowledge; a
        knowledge of measurement, since the art here is concerned with excess
        and defect, and of numeration, as it has to do with odd and even? People
        would admit this, would they not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Protagoras agreed that they would.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, my friends, since we have found that the salvation of our
        life depends on making a right choice of pleasure and pain—of the more
        and the fewer,
      </p>

      <p>
        the greater and the smaller, and the nearer and the remoter—is it not
        evident, in the first place, that measurement is a study of their excess
        and defect and equality in relation to each other?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        This must needs be so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And being measurement, I presume it must be an art or science?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They will assent to this.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, the nature of this art or science we shall consider some other
        time ; but the mere fact of its being a science will suffice for the
        proof which Protagoras and I
      </p>

      <p>
        are required to give in answer to the question you have put to us. You
        asked it, if you remember, when we were agreeing that there is nothing
        stronger than knowledge, and that knowledge, wherever it may be found,
        has always the upper hand of pleasure or anything else; and then you
        said that pleasure often masters even the man of knowledge, and on our
        refusing to agree with you, you went on to ask us: Protagoras and
        Socrates, if this experience is not “being overcome by pleasure,”
      </p>

      <p>
        whatever can it be, and what do you call it? Tell us. If on the spur of
        the moment we had replied, “Ignorance,” you would have laughed us to
        scorn: but now if you laugh at us you will be laughing at yourselves as
        well. For you have admitted that it is from defect of knowledge that men
        err, when they do err, in their choice of pleasures and pains—that is,
        in the choice of good and evil; and from defect not merely of knowledge
        but of the knowledge which you have now admitted also to be that of
        measurement. And surely you know well enough for yourselves
      </p>

      <p>
        that the erring act committed without knowledge is done through
        ignorance. Accordingly “to be overcome by pleasure” means just
        this—ignorance in the highest degree, which Protagoras here and Prodicus
        and Hippias profess to cure. But you, through supposing it to be
        something else than ignorance, will neither go yourselves nor send your
        children to these sophists, who are the teachers of those things—you say
        it cannot be taught; you are chary of your money and will give them
        none,
      </p>

      <p>
        and so you fare badly both in private and in public life.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Such would have been our answer to the world at large. And I ask you
        now, Hippias and Prodicus, as well as Protagoras—for I would have you
        make a joint reply—whether you think what I say is true or false.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They all thought what I had said was absolutely true.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then you agree, I continued, that the pleasant is good and the painful
        bad. And let me entreat my friend Prodicus to spare me his distinction
        of terms:
      </p>

      <p>
        for whether you say pleasant or delightful or enjoyable, my excellent
        Prodicus, or in whatever style or manner you may be pleased to name
        these things, pray reply to the sense of my question.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this Prodicus laughed and consented, as did the rest.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, my friends, I said, what of this? All actions aimed at living
        painlessly and pleasantly are honorable, are they not? And the honorable
        work is both good and useful?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then if, I proceeded, the pleasant is good, no one who has knowledge
      </p>

      <p>
        or thought of other actions as better than those he is doing, and as
        possible, will do as he proposes if he is free to do the better ones;
        and this yielding to oneself is nothing but ignorance, and mastery of
        oneself is as certainly wisdom.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They all agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, by ignorance do you mean having a false opinion and being
        deceived about matters of importance?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        They all agreed to this also.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then surely, I went on, no one willingly goes after evil or what he
        thinks to be evil;
      </p>

      <p>
        it is not in human nature, apparently, to do so—to wish to go after what
        one thinks to be evil in preference to the good; and when compelled to
        choose one of two evils, nobody will choose the greater when he may the
        lesser.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        All this met with the assent of everyone.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I said, is there something you call dread, or fear? And is it—I
        address myself to you, Prodicus —the same as I have in mind—something I
        describe as an expectation of evil, whether you call it fear or dread?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Protagoras and Hippias agreed
      </p>

      <p>
        to this description of dread or fear; but Prodicus thought this was
        dread, not fear.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No matter, Prodicus, I said, but my point is this: if our former
        statements are true, will any man wish to go after what he dreads, when
        he may pursue what he does not? Surely this is impossible after what we
        have admitted—that he regards as evil that which he dreads? And what is
        regarded as evil is neither pursued nor accepted willingly, we saw, by
        anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here also they were all in agreement.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So much, then, being granted, Prodicus and Hippias, I said, let our
        friend Protagoras vindicate the correctness of the answer he made at
        first—not that which he made at the very beginning, when he said that,
        while there were five parts of virtue, none of them was like any other,
        but each had its particular function: I do not refer to that, but the
        statement he made afterwards, when he proceeded to say that four of them
        had a considerable resemblance to each other,
      </p>

      <p>
        but one was quite different from the rest—courage; and he told me I
        should perceive this by the following token: You will find, Socrates,
        said he, that men may be most unholy, most unjust, most dissolute, and
        most ignorant, yet most courageous; whence you may judge that courage is
        very different from the other parts of virtue. His answer caused me
        great surprise at the moment, and still more when I went into the matter
        with your help. But anyhow, I asked him whether by the brave he meant
        “bold.” Yes, he replied, and impetuous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Protagoras, I said, do you remember making this answer?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted he did.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, I said, tell us, towards what do you mean they are impetuous
        when they are courageous? Towards the same things as cowards?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then towards other things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do cowards go after things that allow boldness, and the courageous after
        dreadful things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So people say, Socrates.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite true, I said. But my point is rather,
      </p>

      <p>
        towards what, according to you, are the brave impetuous? Dreadful
        things, in the belief that they are dreadful, or towards what is not
        dreadful?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, he said; the former has just been shown, by the arguments you put
        forward, to be impossible.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite true again, I said; so that if this proof was correct, no one goes
        to meet what he regards as dreadful, since to be overcome by oneself was
        found to be ignorance.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted this.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And yet all men go also to meet what they can face boldly, whether
        cowardly or brave, and in this respect cowardly and brave
      </p>

      <p>
        go to meet the same things.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But still, Socrates, he said, what cowards go to meet is the very
        opposite of what the courageous go to meet. For instance, the latter are
        willing to go to war, but the former are not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Is going to war an honorable thing, I asked, or a base thing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Honorable, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then if it is honorable, we have admitted, by our former argument, that
        it is also good for we agreed that all honorable actions were good.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        True, and I abide by that decision.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You are right to do so, I said.
      </p>

      <p>
        But which sort of men do you say are not willing to go to war, that
        being an honorable and good thing to do?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        The cowardly, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then, I went on, if it is honorable and good, is it also pleasant?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That certainly has been admitted, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now do the cowards wittingly refuse to go to what is more honorable,
        better, and pleasanter?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, if we admit that too, he replied, we shall undo our previous
        admissions.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But what of the courageous man? Does he not go to the more honorable and
        better and pleasanter?
      </p>

      <p>
        I am forced to admit that, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now, in general, courageous men do not feel base fears, when they fear,
        nor is there anything base in their boldness?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        True, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And if not base, then it must be honorable?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He admitted this.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And if honorable, then good?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And the cowardly and the bold and the mad, on the contrary, feel base
        fears and base boldness?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do they feel base and evil boldness solely through stupidity and
        ignorance?
      </p>

      <p>
        Just so, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, the cause of cowards being cowardly, do you call this
        cowardice or courage?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Cowardice, I call it, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And were they not found to be cowards through ignorance of what is
        dreadful?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And so they are cowards because of that ignorance?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He agreed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And the cause of their being cowards is admitted by you to be cowardice?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He assented.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then ignorance of what is dreadful and not dreadful will be cowardice?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He nodded assent.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But surely courage, I went on,
      </p>

      <p>
        is the opposite of cowardice.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then the wisdom that knows what is and what is not dreadful is opposed
        to the ignorance of these things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To this he could still nod assent.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And the ignorance of them is cowardice?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To this he nodded very reluctantly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So the wisdom that knows what is and what is not dreadful is courage,
        being opposed to the ignorance of these things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here he could no longer bring himself to nod agreement, and remained
        silent. Then I proceeded: Why is it, Protagoras, that you neither affirm
        nor deny what I ask you?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Finish it, he said, by yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        I must first ask you, I said, just one more question: Do you still
        think, as at the beginning, that there are any people who are most
        ignorant and yet most courageous?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I see, Socrates, you have set your heart on making me your answerer; so,
        to oblige you, I will say that by what we have admitted I consider it
        impossible.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        My only motive, I then said, in asking all these questions has been a
        desire to examine the various relations of virtue and its own special
        nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        For I know that, were it once made plain, that other question on which
        you and I have argued at such length on either side—you maintaining and
        I denying that virtue can be taught—would be cleared up satisfactorily.
        Our discussion, in its present result, seems to me as though it accused
        and mocked us like some human person; if it were given a voice it would
        say: “What strange creatures you are, Socrates and Protagoras! You on
        the one hand, after having said at first that virtue cannot be taught,
      </p>

      <p>
        are now hot in opposition to yourself, endeavoring to prove that all
        things are knowledge—justice, temperance, and courage—which is the best
        way to make virtue appear teachable: for if virtue were anything else
        than knowledge, as Protagoras tried to make out, obviously it would not
        be teachable; but if as a matter of fact it turns out to be entirely
        knowledge, as you urge, Socrates, I shall be surprised if it is not
        teachable. Protagoras, on the other hand, though at first he claimed
        that it was teachable,
      </p>

      <p>
        now seems as eager for the opposite, declaring that it has been found to
        be almost anything but knowledge, which would make it quite
        unteachable!” Now I, Protagoras, observing the extraordinary tangle into
        which we have managed to get the whole matter, am most anxious to have
        it thoroughly cleared up. And I should like to work our way through it
        until at last we reach what virtue is, and then go back and consider
        whether it is teachable or not, lest perchance your Epimetheus beguile
        and trip us up in our investigation
      </p>

      <p>
        as he overlooked us in your account of his distribution. I like the
        Prometheus of your fable better than the Epimetheus; for he is of use to
        me, and I take Promethean thought continually for my own life when I am
        occupied with all these questions; so, with your consent, as I said at
        the beginning, I should be delighted to have your aid in the inquiry.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I approve your zeal, Socrates, said
        Protagoras, and the way you develop your arguments;
      </p>

      <p>
        for I think I am not ill-natured, and I am the last person on earth to
        be envious. Indeed I have told many people how I regard you—as the man I
        admire far above any that I meet, and as quite an exception to men of
        your age; and I say I should not be surprised if you won high repute for
        wisdom. We shall pursue the subject on some other occasion, at your
        pleasure: for the present,
      </p>

      <p>
        it is time to turn to another affair.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I quite agree, said I, if you think so: for I was long ago due to be
        where I told you I was going; I stayed merely to oblige our excellent
        Callias.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Here our colloquy ended, and each went his way.
      </p>
