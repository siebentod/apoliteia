        <i>Socrates, Chaerephon, Critias, Charmides</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We arrived yesterday evening from the army at Potidaea, and I sought
        with delight, after an absence of some time, my wonted conversations.
        Accordingly I went into the wrestling-school of Taureas, opposite the
        Queen's shrine, and there I came upon quite a number of people, some of
        whom were unknown to me, but most of whom I knew. And as soon as they
        saw me
      </p>

      <p>
        appear thus unexpectedly, they hailed me from a distance on every side;
        but Chaerephon, like the mad creature that he is, jumped up from their
        midst and ran to me, and grasping me by the hand—
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Socrates, he said, how did you survive the battle? (Shortly before we
        came away there had been a battle at Potidaea, of which the people here
        had only just had news.)
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In the state in which you see me, I replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It has been reported here, you know, said he, that the battle was very
      </p>

      <p>
        severe, and that many of our acquaintance have lost their lives in it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then the report, I replied, is pretty near the truth.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You were present, he asked, at the fighting?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I was present.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then sit down here, he said, and give us a full account; for as yet we
        have had no clear report of it all. And with that he led me to a seat by
        Critias, son of Callaeschrus. So I sat down there and greeted Critias
        and the rest, and gave them all the news from the battlefield, in answer
        to their various questions; each had his inquiry to make.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we had had enough of such matters, I in my turn began to inquire
        about affairs at home, how philosophy was doing at present, and whether
        any of the rising young men had distinguished themselves for wisdom or
        beauty or both. Then Critias, looking towards the door,
      </p>

      <p>
        for he saw some young fellows who were coming in with some railing at
        each other, and a crowd of people following on behind them,
        said—Concerning the beauties, Socrates, I expect you will get your
        knowledge at once: for these who are coming in are in fact forerunners
        and lovers of the person who is held, for the moment at least, to be the
        greatest beauty; and he himself, I imagine, must by now be nearly upon
        us.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Who is he, I asked, and whose son?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You must know, he replied, but he was not yet grown up when you went
        away,—Charmides, son of
      </p>

      <p>
        our uncle Glaucon, and my cousin.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do know, to be sure, I said; for he was not to be despised even then,
        when he was still a child, and now, I suppose, he will be quite a youth
        by this time.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You will know this moment, he said, both how much and to what purpose he
        has grown. And just as he spoke these words, Charmides entered.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now I, my good friend, am no measurer: I am a mere “white line” in
        measuring beautiful people, for almost everyone who has just grown up
        appears beautiful to me. Nay and this time, moreover, the young man
        appeared to me
      </p>

      <p>
        a marvel of stature and beauty; and all the rest, to my thinking, were
        in love with him, such was their astonishment and confusion when he came
        in, and a number of other lovers were following in his train. On the
        part of men like us it was not so surprising; but when I came to observe
        the boys I noticed that none of them, not even the smallest, had eyes
        for anything else, but that
      </p>

      <p>
        they all gazed at him as if he were a statue. Then Chaerephon called me
        and said—How does the youth strike you, Socrates? Has he not a fine
        face?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Immensely so, I replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yet if he would consent to strip, he said, you would think he had no
        face, he has such perfect beauty of form.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And these words of Chaerephon were repeated by the rest. Then,—By
        Heracles! I said, what an irresistible person you make him out to be, if
        he has but one more thing—a little thing—besides.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        What? said Critias.
      </p>

      <p>
        If in his soul, I replied, he is of good grain. And I should think,
        Critias, he ought to be, since he is of your house.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Ah, he said, he is right fair and good in that way also.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why then, I said, let us strip that very part of him and view it first,
        instead of his form; for anyhow, at that age, I am sure he is quite
        ready to have a discussion.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Very much so, said Critias; for, I may say, he is in fact
      </p>

      <p>
        a philosopher, and also—as others besides himself consider—quite a poet.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That, my dear Critias, I said, is a gift which your family has had a
        long while back, through your kinship with Solon. But why not call the
        young man here and show him to me? For surely, even if he were younger
        still, there could be no discredit in our having a talk with him before
        you, who are at once his guardian and his cousin.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You are quite right he said, and we will call him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thereupon he said to his attendant,—Boy, call Charmides; tell him I want
        him to see a doctor about the ailment with which he told me he was
        troubled yesterday. Then, turning to me,—You know, he has spoken lately
        of having a headache, said Critias, on getting up in the morning: now
        why should you not represent to him that you know a cure for headache?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why not? I said: only he must come.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Oh, he will be here, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And so it was; for he came, and caused much laughter, because each of us
        who were seated
      </p>

      <p>
        made room for him by pushing hard at his neighbor so as to have him
        sitting beside himself, until at either end of the seat one had to stand
        up, and we tumbled the other off sideways; and he came and sat down
        between me and Critias. But here, my friend, I began to feel perplexed,
        and my former confidence in looking forward to a quite easy time in
        talking with him had been knocked out of me. And when, on Critias
        telling him that it was I who knew the cure,
      </p>

      <p>
        he gave me such a look with his eyes as passes description, and was just
        about to plunge into a question, and when all the people in the
        wrestling-school surged round about us on every side—then, ah then, my
        noble friend, I saw inside his cloak and caught fire, and could possess
        myself no longer; and I thought none was so wise in love-matters as
        Cydias, who in speaking of a beautiful boy recommends someone to “beware
        of coming as a fawn before the lion, and being seized as his portion of
        flesh”; for I too felt
      </p>

      <p>
        I had fallen a prey to some such creature. However, when he had asked me
        if I knew the cure for headache, I somehow contrived to answer that I
        knew.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then what is it? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So I told him that the thing itself was a certain leaf, but there was a
        charm to go with the remedy; and if one uttered the charm at the moment
        of its application, the remedy made one perfectly well; but without the
        charm there was no efficacy in the leaf.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I will take down the charm, said he, from you in writing.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Do you prefer, I asked, to get my consent first, or to do without it?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        This made him laugh, and he said: To get your consent, Socrates.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Very well, I said; and are you certain of my name?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Unless I misjudge, he replied; for there is no little talk of you. among
        the set of our age, and I remember as a mere child the sight of you in
        company with Critias here.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That is a good thing, I said: for I shall speak more freely to you
      </p>

      <p>
        about the charm, and its real nature; just now I was at a loss for the
        way to apprise you of its power. For it is of such a nature, Charmides,
        that it cannot cure the head alone; I daresay you have yourself
        sometimes heard good doctors say, you know, when a patient comes to them
        with a pain in his eyes, that it is not possible for them to attempt a
        cure of his eyes alone, but that it is necessary to treat his head too
        at the same time,
      </p>

      <p>
        if he is to have his eyes in good order; and so again, that to expect
        ever to treat the head by itself, apart from the body as a whole, is
        utter folly. And on this principle they apply their regimen to the whole
        body, and attempt to treat and heal the part along with the whole; or
        have you not observed that this is what they say, and is done in fact?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly I have, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you consider it well said, and accept the principle?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Most assuredly, he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I, on hearing his approval, regained my courage; and little by
        little I began to muster up my confidence again, and my spirit began to
        rekindle. So I said,—Such, then, Charmides, is the nature of this charm.
        I learnt it on campaign over there, from one of the Thracian physicians
        of Zalmoxis, who are said even to make one immortal. This Thracian said
        that the Greeks were right in advising as I told you just now: “but
        Zalmoxis,” he said,
      </p>

      <p>
        “our king, who is a god, says that as you ought not to attempt to cure
        eyes without head, or head without body, so you should not treat body
        without soul”; and this was the reason why most maladies evaded the
        physicians of Greece—that they neglected the whole, on which they ought
        to spend their pains, for if this were out of order it was impossible
        for the part to be in order. For all that was good and evil, he said, in
        the body and in man altogether was sprung from the soul, and flowed
        along from thence as it did
      </p>

      <p>
        from the head into the eyes. Wherefore that part was to be treated first
        and foremost, if all was to be well with the head and the rest of the
        body. And the treatment of the soul, so he said, my wonderful friend, is
        by means of certain charms, and these charms are words of the right
        sort: by the use of such words is temperance engendered in our souls,
        and as soon as it is engendered and present we may easily secure health
        to the head and to the rest of the body also.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now in teaching me the remedy and the charms he remarked,—” Let nobody
        persuade you to treat his head with this remedy, unless he has first
        submitted his soul for you to treat with the charm. For at present,” he
        said, “the cure of mankind is beset with the error of certain doctors
        who attempt to practise the one method without the other.” And he most
        particularly enjoined on me not to let anyone, however wealthy or noble
        or handsome,
      </p>

      <p>
        induce me to disobey him. So I, since I have given him my oath, and must
        obey him, will do as he bids; and if you agree to submit your soul first
        to the effect of the Thracian charms, according to the stranger's
        injunctions, I will apply the remedy to your head: otherwise we shall be
        at a loss what to do with you, my dear Charmides.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Critias, when he heard me say this, remarked,—This affection of the
        head, Socrates, will turn out to be a stroke of luck for the young man,
        if he is to be compelled
      </p>

      <p>
        on account of his head to improve his understanding also. However, let
        me tell you, Charmides is considered to excel his comrades not only in
        appearance, but also in that very thing which you say is produced by
        your charm: temperance, you say it is, do you not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, I replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then be assured, he said, that he is considered to be far and away the
        most temperate person now alive, while in every other respect, for a
        youth of his age, he is second to none.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, yes, I said, and it is only right, Charmides, that you should excel
        the rest in all these respects; for
      </p>

      <p>
        I do not suppose there is anyone else here who could readily point to a
        case of any two Athenian houses uniting together which would be likely
        to produce handsomer or nobler offspring than those from which you are
        sprung. For your father's house, which comes from Critias, son of
        Dropides, has been celebrated by Anacreon and Solon and many other
        poets, so that it is famed by tradition among us as preeminent in beauty
        and virtue
      </p>

      <p>
        and all else that is accounted happiness; and then, your mother's house
        is famous in the same way, for of Pyrilampes, your uncle, it is said
        that no one in all the continent was considered to be his superior in
        beauty or stature, whenever he came as envoy to the great king or anyone
        else in Asia, and his house as a whole is no whit inferior to the other.
        Sprung from such people, it is to be supposed that you would be first in
        all things. And indeed,
      </p>

      <p>
        as regards your visible form, dear son of Glaucon, I consider that
        nowhere have you fallen behind any of your ancestors. But if your nature
        is really rich in temperance and those other things, as our friend here
        says, blessed is the son, dear Charmides, I exclaimed, that your mother
        has borne in you! However, the case stands thus: if you already possess
        temperance, as Critias here declares, and you are sufficiently
        temperate, then you never had any need of the charms of Zalmoxis or of
        Abaris the Hyperborean,
      </p>

      <p>
        and might well be given at once the remedy for the head; but if you
        prove to be still lacking that virtue, we must apply the charm before
        the remedy. So tell me yourself whether you agree with our friend, and
        can say that you are already sufficiently provided with temperance, or
        are deficient in it?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        At this Charmides blushed and, for one thing, looked more beautiful then
        ever, for his modesty became his years; and then, too, he answered most
        ingenuously, saying it was no easy matter at the moment either to admit
        or to deny the words of the question. For if,
      </p>

      <p>
        he went on, I say I am not temperate, not only is it a strange thing to
        say against oneself, but I shall at the same time be taxing with untruth
        both Critias and many others who consider me to be temperate, as he
        gives out; while if, on the other hand, I say I am, and praise myself,
        it will probably be found distasteful; so that I cannot see what answer
        I am to give you.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then I said: Your answer is a natural one, in my opinion, Charmides; and
        I think, I went on, that we must join in inquiring whether you possess
        the thing I am asking after, or not, in order that
      </p>

      <p>
        neither you may be forced to say what you do not wish, nor I on my part
        may recklessly try my hand at medicine. So if it is agreeable to you, I
        am ready to inquire with you; but, if it is not, to let it alone.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, nothing, he said, could be more agreeable to me : so far as that
        goes, therefore, inquire in whatever way you think we had better
        proceed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then this is the way, I said, in which I consider that our inquiry into
        this matter had best be conducted. Now, it is clear that, if you
      </p>

      <p>
        have temperance with you, you can hold an opinion about it. For being in
        you, I presume it must, in that case, afford some perception from which
        you can form some opinion of what temperance is, and what kind of thing
        it is : do you not think so ?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And since you understand the Greek tongue, I said, you can tell me, I
        suppose, your view of this particular thought of yours?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I daresay, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then in order that we may make a guess whether it is in you or not, tell
        me, I said, what you say of temperance according to your opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        He at first hung back, and was not at all willing to answer: but
        presently he said that, to his mind, temperance was doing everything
        orderly and quietly—walking in the streets, talking, and doing
        everything else of that kind; and in a word, he said, I think the thing
        about which you ask may be called quietness.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I said, are you right there? They do say, you know, Charmides,
        that quiet people are temperate : so let us see if there is anything in
        what they say. Tell me, is not temperance,
      </p>

      <p>
        however, among the honorable things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To be sure, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, which is most honorable at the writing master's, to write the same
        sort of letters quickly or quietly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quickly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And in reading, to do it quickly or slowly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quickly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And so, in the same way, to play the lyre quickly, or to wrestle nimbly,
        is far more honorable than to do it quietly and slowly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And what of boxing, alone or combined with wrestling? Is it not the same
        there too?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To be sure.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And in running and leaping and all activities
      </p>

      <p>
        of the body, are not nimble and quick movements accounted honorable,
        while sluggish and quiet ones are deemed disgraceful?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So we find, I said, that in the body, at least, it is not quietness, but
        the greatest quickness and nimbleness that is most honorable, do we not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And temperance was an honorable thing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then in the body, at least, it is not quietness but quickness that will
        be the more temperate thing, since temperance is honorable.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So it seems, he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well now, I went on; in learning, is facility the more honorable, or
        difficulty?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Facility.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And facility in learning, I said, is learning quickly, and difficulty in
        learning is learning quietly and slowly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And is it not more honorable to teach another quickly and forcibly,
        rather than quietly and slowly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, is it more honorable to be reminded and to remember quietly
        and slowly, or forcibly and quickly?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Forcibly, he replied, and quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        And is not readiness of mind a sort of nimbleness of the soul, not a
        quietness?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        True.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And to apprehend what is said, whether at the writing-master's or the
        lyre-master's or anywhere else, not as quietly as possible, but as
        quickly, is most honorable?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, and in the searchings of the soul, and in deliberation, it is not
        the quietest person, I imagine, or he who deliberates and discovers with
        difficulty, that is held worthy of praise, but he who does this most
        easily and quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is so, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then in all, I said, Charmides, that concerns either our soul or our
        body, actions of quickness and nimbleness are found to be more honorable
        than those of slowness and quietness?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It looks like it, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So temperance cannot be a sort of quietness, nor can the temperate life
        be quiet, by this argument at least; since, being temperate, it must be
        honorable.
      </p>

      <p>
        For we have these two alternatives: either in no cases, or I should
        think in very few, can we find that the quiet actions in life are more
        honorable than the quick and vigorous ones; or at all events, my friend,
        if of the more honorable actions there are absolutely as many quiet ones
        as forcible and quick, not even so will temperance be acting quietly any
        more than acting forcibly and quickly, either in walking or in talking
        or in any other sphere; nor will the quiet life be more temperate than
        the unquiet; since
      </p>

      <p>
        in our argument we assumed that temperance is an honorable thing, and
        have found that quick things are just as honorable as quiet things.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Your statement, he said, Socrates, seems to me to be correct.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Once more then, I went on, Charmides, attend more closely and look into
        yourself; reflect on the quality that is given you by the presence of
        temperance, and what quality it must have to work this effect on you.
        Take stock of all this and tell me, like a good, brave fellow, what it
        appears to you to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        He paused a little, and after a quite manly effort of self-examination:
        Well, I think, he said, that temperance makes men ashamed or bashful,
        and that temperance is the same as modesty.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, I asked, did you not admit a moment ago that temperance is
        honorable?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly I did, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And temperate men are also good?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, can that be good which does not produce good men?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, indeed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And we conclude that it is not only honorable, but good also.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, I said, are you not convinced that Homer is right in saying—
        “Modesty, no good mate for a needy man?”
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I am, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then it would seem that modesty is not good, and good.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But temperance is good, if its presence makes men good, and not bad.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It certainly seems to me to be as you say.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So temperance cannot be modesty, if it
      </p>

      <p>
        is in fact good, while modesty is no more good than evil.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, I think, he said, Socrates, that is correctly stated; but there is
        another view of temperance on which I would like to have your opinion. I
        remembered just now what I once heard someone say, that temperance might
        be doing one's own business. I ask you, then, do you think he is right
        in saying this?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You rascal, I said, you have heard it from Critias here,
      </p>

      <p>
        or some other of our wise men!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Seemingly, said Critias, from some other; for indeed he did not from me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But what does it matter, Socrates, said Charmides, from whom I heard it?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not at all, I replied; for in any case we have not to consider who said
        it, but whether it is a true saying or no.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now you speak rightly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, on my word, I said: but I shall be surprised if we can find out how
        it stands; for it looks like a kind of riddle.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why so? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Because, I replied, presumably the speaker of the words
      </p>

      <p>
        “temperance is doing one's own business” did not mean them quite as he
        spoke them. Or do you consider that the scribe does nothing when he
        writes or reads?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I rather consider that he does something, he replied. And does the
        scribe, in your opinion, write and read his own name only, and teach you
        boys to do the same with yours? Or did you write your enemies' names
        just as much as your own and your friends'?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Just as much.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, were you meddlesome or intemperate
      </p>

      <p>
        in doing this?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not at all.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you know you were not doing your own business, if writing and
        reading are doing something.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, so they are.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And indeed medical work, my good friend, and building and weaving and
        producing anything whatever that is the work of any art, I presume is
        doing something.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well then, I went on, do you think a state would be well conducted under
        a law which enjoined that everyone should weave and scour his own coat,
        and make his own shoes, and his own flask and scraper,
      </p>

      <p>
        and everything else on the same principle of not touching the affairs of
        others but performing and doing his own for himself?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I think not, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But still, I said, a state whose conduct is temperate will be well
        conducted.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Of course, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then doing one's own business in that sense and in that way will not be
        temperance.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So that person was riddling, it seems, just as I said a moment ago, when
        he said that doing one's own business is temperance. For I take it he
        was not such a fool as all that: or was it some idiot
      </p>

      <p>
        that you heard saying this, Charmides?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Far from it, he replied, for indeed he seemed to be very wise.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then it is perfectly certain, in my opinion, that he propounded it as a
        riddle, in view of the difficulty of understanding what “doing one's own
        business” can mean.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I daresay, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, what can it mean, this “doing one's own business”? Can you tell
        me?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I do not know, upon my word, he replied: but
        I daresay it may be that not even he who said it knew in the least what
        he meant. And as he said this he gave a sly laugh and glanced at
        Critias.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now Critias for some time had been plainly burning with anxiety to
        distinguish himself in the eyes of Charmides and the company, and having
        with difficulty restrained himself heretofore, he now could do so no
        longer; for I believe that what I had supposed was perfectly true—that
        Charmides had heard this answer about temperance from Critias. And so
        Charmides, wishing him to make answer
      </p>

      <p>
        instead of himself, sought to stir him up in particular, and pointed out
        that he himself had been refuted; but Critias rebelled against it, and
        seemed to me to have got angry with him, as a poet does with an actor
        who mishandles his verses on the stage: so he looked hard at him and
        said: Do you really suppose, Charmides, that if you do not know what can
        have been the meaning of the man who said that temperance was doing
        one's own business, he did not know either?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, my excellent Critias, I said, no wonder if our friend, at his age,
        cannot understand; but you,
      </p>

      <p>
        I should think, may be expected to know, in view of your years and your
        studies. So if you concede that temperance is what he says, and you
        accept the statement, for my part I would greatly prefer to have you as
        partner in the inquiry as to whether this saying is true or not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I quite concede it, he said, and accept it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That is good, then, I said. Now tell me, do you also concede what I was
        asking just now—that all craftsmen make something?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And do you consider that they make their own things only, or those of
        others also?
      </p>

      <p>
        Those of others also.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And are they temperate in not making their own things only?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes: what reason is there against it? he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        None for me, I replied; but there may be for him who, after assuming
        that temperance is doing one's own business, proceeds to say there is no
        reason against those also who do others' business being temperate.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And have I, pray, he said, admitted that those who do others' business
        are temperate? Or was my admission of those who make things?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Tell me, I said, do you not call making and doing the same?
      </p>

      <p>
        No indeed, he replied, nor working and making the same either: this I
        learnt from Hesiod, who said, “Work is no reproach.” Now, do you suppose
        that if he had given the names of working and doing to such works as you
        were mentioning just now, he would have said there was no reproach in
        shoe-making or pickle-selling or serving the stews? It is not to be
        thought, Socrates; he rather held,
      </p>

      <p>
        I conceive, that making was different from doing and working, and that
        while a thing made might be a reproach if it had no connection with the
        honorable, work could never be a reproach. For things honorably and
        usefully made he called works, and such makings he called workings and
        doings; and we must suppose that it was only such things as these that
        he called our proper concerns, but all that was harmful, the concerns of
        others. So that we must conclude that Hesiod, and anyone else of good
        sense, calls him temperate who does his own business.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah, Critias, I said, you had hardly begun, when I grasped the purport of
        your speech—that you called one's proper and one's own things good, and
        that the makings of the good you called doings; for in fact I have heard
        Prodicus drawing innumerable distinctions between names. Well, I will
        allow you any application of a name that you please; only make clear to
        what thing it is that you attach such-and-such a name. So begin now over
        again, and define more plainly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you say that this doing or making, or whatever is the term you
        prefer, of good things, is temperance?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then not he who does evil, but he who does good, is temperate?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And do not you, my excellent friend, he said, think so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Leave that aside, I said; for we have not to consider yet what I think,
        but what you say now.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, all the same, I say, he replied, that he who does evil instead of
        good is not temperate, whereas he who does good instead of evil is
        temperate : for I give you “the doing of good things is temperance” as
        my plain definition.
      </p>

      <p>
        And there is no reason, I daresay, why your statement should not be
        right; but still I wonder, I went on, whether you judge that temperate
        men are ignorant of their temperance.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, I do not, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        A little while ago, I said, were you not saying that there was no reason
        why craftsmen should not be temperate in making others' things as well?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I was, he said, but what of it ?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nothing; only tell me whether you think that a doctor, in making someone
        healthy,
      </p>

      <p>
        makes a helpful result both for himself and for the person whom he
        cures.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And he who does this does his duty?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Is not he who does his duty temperate?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Indeed he is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, and must the doctor know when his medicine will be helpful, and
        when not? And must every craftsman know when he is likely to be
        benefited by the work he does, and when not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Probably not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then sometimes, I went on, the doctor may have done what is helpful
      </p>

      <p>
        or harmful without knowing the effect of his own action; and yet, in
        doing what was helpful, by your statement, he has done temperately. Or
        did you not state that?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I did.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then it would seem that in doing what is helpful he may sometimes do
        temperately and be temperate, but be ignorant of his own temperance?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But that, he said, Socrates, could never be: if you think this in any
        way a necessary inference from my previous admissions,
      </p>

      <p>
        I would rather withdraw some of them, and not be ashamed to say my
        statements were wrong, than concede at any time that a man who is
        ignorant of himself is temperate. For I would almost say that this very
        thing, self-knowledge, is temperance, and I am at one with him who put
        up the inscription of those words at Delphi. For the purpose of that
        inscription on the temple, as it seems to me, is to serve as the god's
        salutation to those who enter it, instead of
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hail!”—this is a wrong form of greeting, and they should rather exhort
        one another with the words, “Be temperate!” And thus the god addresses
        those who are entering his temple in a mode which differs from that of
        men; such was the intention of the dedicator of the inscription in
        putting it up, I believe; and that he says to each man who enters, in
        reality, “Be temperate !” But he says it in a rather riddling fashion,
        as a prophet would; for “Know thyself!” and “Be temperate!” are the
        same, as
      </p>

      <p>
        the inscription and I declare, though one is likely enough to think them
        different—an error into which I consider the dedicators of the later
        inscriptions fell when they put up “Nothing overmuch” and “A pledge, and
        thereupon perdition.” For they supposed that “Know thyself!” was a piece
        of advice, and not the god's salutation of those who were entering; and
        so, in order that their dedications too might equally give pieces of
        useful advice, they wrote these words and dedicated them. Now my object
        in saying all this, Socrates, is to abandon to you all the previous
        argument—
      </p>

      <p>
        for, though perhaps it was you who were more in the right, or perhaps it
        was I, yet nothing at all certain emerged from our statements—and to
        proceed instead to satisfy you of this truth, if you do not admit it,
        that temperance is knowing oneself.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, Critias, I said, you treat me as though I professed to know the
        things on which I ask questions, and needed only the will to agree with
        you. But the fact of the matter is rather that I join you in the
        inquiry, each time that a proposition is made, because I myself do not
        know; I wish therefore to consider first,
      </p>

      <p>
        before I tell you whether I agree or not. Now, give me a moment to
        consider.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Consider then, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, and I am considering, I said. For if temperance is knowing
        anything, obviously it must be a kind of science, and a science of
        something, must it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It is, he replied, and of itself.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And medicine, I said, is a science of health?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then if you should ask me, I said, wherein medicine, as a science of
        health, is useful to us, and what it produces,
      </p>

      <p>
        I should say it is of very great benefit, since it produces health; an
        excellent result, if you allow so much.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I allow it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And so, if you should ask me what result I take to be produced by
        building, as the builder's science, I should say houses; and it would be
        the same with the other arts. Now it is for you, in your turn, to find
        an answer to a question regarding temperance—since you say it is a
        science of self, Critias—and to tell me what excellent result it
        produces for us,
      </p>

      <p>
        as science of self, and what it does that is worthy of its name. Come
        now, tell me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But, Socrates, he said, you are not inquiring rightly. For in its nature
        it is not like the other sciences, any more than any of them is like any
        other; whereas you are making your inquiry as though they were alike.
        For tell me, he said, what result is there of the arts of reckoning and
        geometry, in the way that a house is of building, or a coat of weaving,
        or other products of the sort that one might point to
      </p>

      <p>
        in various arts? Well, can you, for your part, point to any such product
        in those two cases? You cannot.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To this I replied: What you say is true; but I can point out to you what
        is the peculiar subject of each of these sciences, distinct in each case
        from the science itself. Thus reckoning, I suppose, is concerned with
        the even and the odd in their numerical relations to themselves and to
        one another, is it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you grant that the odd and the even are different from the actual
        art of reckoning?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Of course.
      </p>

      <p>
        And once more, weighing is concerned with the heavier and the lighter
        weight; but the heavy and the light are different from the actual art of
        weighing: you agree?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I do.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then tell me, what is that of which temperance is the science, differing
        from temperance itself?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There you are, Socrates, he said: you push your investigation up to the
        real question at issue—in what temperance differs from all the other
        sciences—but you then proceed to seek some resemblance between it
      </p>

      <p>
        and them; whereas there is no such thing, for while all the rest of the
        sciences have something other than themselves as their subject, this one
        alone is a science of the other sciences and of its own self. And of
        this you are far from being unconscious, since in fact, as I believe,
        you are doing the very thing you denied you were doing just now: for you
        are attempting to refute me, without troubling to follow the subject of
        our discussion.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How can you think, I said, if my main effort is to refute you, that I do
        it with any other motive than that which
      </p>

      <p>
        would impel me to investigate the meaning of my own words—from a fear of
        carelessly supposing, at any moment, that I knew something while I knew
        it not? And so it is now: that is what I am doing, I tell you. I am
        examining the argument mainly for my own sake, but also, perhaps, for
        that of my other intimates. Or do you not think it is for the common
        good, almost, of all men, that the truth about everything there is
        should be discovered?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes indeed, he replied, I do, Socrates.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then take heart, I said, my admirable friend, and answer the question
        put to you as you deem the case to be, without caring a jot
      </p>

      <p>
        whether it is Critias or Socrates who is being refuted: give the
        argument itself your attention, and observe what will become of it under
        the test of refutation.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, he said, I will do so; for I think there is a good deal in what
        you say.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then tell me, I said, what you mean in regard to temperance.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Why, I mean, he said, that it alone of all the sciences is the science
        both of itself and of the other sciences.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So then, I said, it will be the science of the lack of science also,
        besides being the science of science?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then only the temperate person will know himself, and be able to discern
        what he really knows and does not know, and have the power of judging
        what other people likewise know and think they know, in cases where they
        do know, and again, what they think they know, without knowing it;
        everyone else will be unable. And so this is being temperate, or
        temperance, and knowing oneself—that one should know what one knows and
        what one does not know. Is that what you mean?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It is, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Once more then, I said, as our third offering to the Saviour,
      </p>

      <p>
        let us consider afresh, in the first place, whether such a thing as this
        is possible or not—to know that one knows, and does not know, what one
        knows and what one does not know; and secondly, if this is perfectly
        possible, what benefit we get by knowing it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We must indeed consider, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Come then, I said, Critias, consider if you can show yourself any more
        resourceful than I am; for I am at a loss. Shall I explain to you in
        what way?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By all means, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, I said, what all this comes to, if your last statement was
        correct, is merely that there is one science which
      </p>

      <p>
        is precisely a science of itself and of the other sciences, and moreover
        is a science of the lack of science at the same time.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then mark what a strange statement it is that we are attempting to make,
        my friend: for if you will consider it as applied to other cases, you
        will surely see—so I believe—its impossibility.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How so? In what cases?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In the following: ask yourself if you think there is a sort of vision
        which is not the vision of things that we see in the ordinary way, but a
        vision of itself and of the other sorts of vision,
      </p>

      <p>
        and of the lack of vision likewise; which, while being vision, sees no
        color, but only itself and the other sorts of vision. Do you think there
        is any such?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Upon my word, I do not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And what do you say to a sort of hearing which hears not a single sound,
        but hears itself and the other sorts of hearing and lack of hearing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I reject that also.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then take all the senses together as a whole, and consider if you think
        there is any sense of the senses and of itself, but insensible of any of
        the things of which the other senses are sensible.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I do not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, do you think there is any desire which is the desire, not of any
        pleasure, but of itself and of the other desires ?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, indeed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nor, again, is there a wish, I imagine, that wishes no good, but wishes
        itself and the other wishes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite so; there is not.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And would you say there is any love of such a sort that it is actually a
        love of no beauty, but of itself and of the other loves?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not I, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And have you ever observed any fear which fears itself
      </p>

      <p>
        and the other fears, but has no fear of a single dreadful thing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, I have not, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Or an opinion which is an opinion of opinions and of itself, but without
        any opinion such as the other opinions have?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But it is apparently a science of this kind that we are assuming—one
        that is a science of no branch of study, but a science of itself and of
        the other sciences.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So we are.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And it is a strange thing, if it really exists? For we should not affirm
        as yet that it does not exist, but should still consider whether it does
        exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are right.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, this science is a science of something, that is, it has a
        certain faculty whereby it can be a science of something, has it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        For, you know, we say the greater has a certain faculty whereby it can
        be greater than something?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Quite so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That is, than something smaller, if it is to be greater.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Necessarily.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So if we could find a greater which is greater than other greater
        things, and than itself, but not greater than the things
      </p>

      <p>
        beside which the others are greater, I take it there can be no doubt
        that it would be in the situation of being, if greater than itself, at
        the same time smaller than itself, would it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Most inevitably, Socrates, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Or again, if there is a double of other doubles and of itself, both it
        and the others must of course be halves, if it is to be their double;
        for, you know, a double cannot be “of” anything else than its half.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        True.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And what is more than itself will also be less, and the heavier will be
        lighter, and the older
      </p>

      <p>
        younger, and so on with everything else: whatever has its own faculty
        applied to itself will have also the natural quality to which its
        faculty was applicable, will it not? For instance, hearing is, as we
        say, just a hearing of sound, is it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So if it is to hear itself, it will hear a sound of its own; for it
        would not hear otherwise.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Most inevitably.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And sight, I suppose, my excellent friend, if it is to see itself, must
        needs have a color; for sight
      </p>

      <p>
        can never see what is colorless.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No more it can.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do you perceive, Critias, in the various cases we have propounded,
        how some of them strike us as absolutely impossible, while others raise
        serious doubts as to the faculty of the thing being ever applicable to
        itself? For with magnitudes, numbers, and the like it is absolutely
        impossible, is it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But again, with hearing and sight, or in the further bases of motion
        moving itself and heat burning itself, and all other
      </p>

      <p>
        actions of the sort, the fact must appear incredible to some, but
        perhaps not to others. So what we want, my friend, is some great man who
        will determine to our satisfaction in every respect whether there is
        nothing in nature so constituted as to have its own faculty applicable
        to itself, and not only some other object, or whether there are some
        such, and others not such; and whether, again, if there are things that
        have such relation to themselves, they include a science which we assert
        to be temperance. For my part, I distrust my own competence to determine
        these questions, and hence I am neither able to affirm whether it is
        possible
      </p>

      <p>
        that there should be a science of science, nor willing, let it be ever
        so true, to acknowledge this to be temperance until I have made out
        whether such a thing as this would benefit us or not. For, you see, I
        have a presentiment that temperance is something beneficial and good;
        and you, therefore, son of Callaeschrus—since you lay it down that
        temperance is this very science of science, and moreover of the lack of
        science—shall first indicate the possibility, as I put it just now, and
        then the benefit added to the possibility, of such a thing;
      </p>

      <p>
        and perhaps you will then satisfy me that your definition of temperance
        is correct.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Now when Critias heard this and saw me in a difficulty, he seemed to
        me—just as the sight of someone yawning opposite causes people to be
        affected in the same way—to be compelled by the sense of my difficulty
        to be caught in a difficulty himself. And so, since he usually contrived
        to distinguish himself, he was too ashamed to bring himself to admit to
        me before the company that he was unable to determine the questions
      </p>

      <p>
        with which I challenged him, and he made a very indistinct reply in
        order to conceal his difficulty. Then I, to forward the discussion,
        remarked: Well, if you prefer, Critias, let us concede for the moment
        that there may possibly be a science of science : some other time we
        shall consider whether such is the fact or not. Come then; suppose it is
        perfectly possible: how is one helped thereby to know what one knows and
        does not know? For this, you are aware, we said was the meaning of
        self-knowledge and temperance, did we not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly, he said; and it must surely follow, Socrates;
      </p>

      <p>
        for if a man has a science which knows itself, he will be similar
        himself to that which he has. For instance, he who has swiftness will be
        swift, he who has beauty will be beautiful, and he who has knowledge
        will know; and when he has knowledge that is of itself, he will then,
        surely, be in the position of knowing himself.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I do not dispute, I said, that when a man has
        that which knows itself he will know himself; but having that, how is he
        bound to know what he knows and what he does not know?
      </p>

      <p>
        Because, Socrates, the two things are the same.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I daresay, I said; but I am afraid I am still my old self: I still do
        not see how knowing what one knows and does not know is the same as the
        other.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How do you mean? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In this way, I replied: will a science of science, if such exists, be
        able to do more than determine that one of two things is science, and
        the other is not science?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, only that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, is science or lack of science of health the same as science or lack
        of science of justice?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        For the one, I suppose, is medicine, and the other politics, while the
        thing in question is merely science.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, to be sure.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And if a man has no added knowledge of health and justice, but knows
        only science, as having science of that alone, he will probably know
        that he has a certain piece of scientific knowledge about himself and
        about other people, will he not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
      </p>

      <p>
        But how will this science help him to know what he knows? For of course
        he knows health by means of medicine, not temperance, and harmony by
        means of music, not temperance, and building by means of the builder's
        art, not temperance; and so it will be in every case, will it not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And how will temperance, supposing it is only a science of sciences,
        help him to know that he knows health, or that he knows building?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then he who is ignorant of all this will not know what he knows, but
        only that he knows.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So it seems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then being temperate, or temperance, will not be this knowledge of what
        one knows or does not know, but, it would seem, merely knowing that one
        knows or does not know.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It looks like it.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then such a person will also be unable to examine another man's claim to
        some knowledge, and make out whether he knows or does not know what he
        says he knows: he will merely know, it would seem, that he has a certain
        knowledge; but of what it is, temperance will not cause him to know.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently not.
      </p>

      <p>
        So he will be able to distinguish neither the man who pretends to be a
        doctor, but is none, from the man who really is one, nor any other man
        who has knowledge from him who has none. But let us consider it another
        way: if the temperate man or anybody else would discriminate between the
        true doctor and the false, he will go to work thus, will he not? He will
        surely not talk to him about medicine; for, as we were saying, the
        doctor understands nothing else but health and disease. Is not that so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, it is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But about science he knows nothing, for that, you know, we assigned to
        temperance alone.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So the medical man knows nothing about medicine either, since
      </p>

      <p>
        medicine is, of course, a science.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        True.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then the temperate man will know, indeed, that the doctor has a certain
        science; but when he has to put its nature to the proof, must he not
        consider what its subjects are? Is not each science marked out, not
        merely as a science, but as a particular one, by the particular subjects
        it has?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        It is, to be sure.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And medicine is marked out as different from the other sciences by being
        a science of health and disease.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And so anyone who wishes to inquire into medicine
      </p>

      <p>
        must make those things, whatever they may be, with which it is
        concerned, the matter of his inquiry; not those foreign things, I
        presume, with which it is not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, indeed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then he who conducts his inquiry aright will consider the doctor, as a
        medical man, in connection with cases of health and disease.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So it seems.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And will inquire whether, in what is said or done in such cases, his
        words are truly spoken, and his acts rightly done?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        He must.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, could anyone follow up either of these points without the
        medical art?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nobody at all, it would seem, but a doctor; and so not the temperate man
        either: for he would have to be a doctor, in addition to his temperance.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That is so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then inevitably, if temperance is only a science of science and of lack
        of science, it will be equally unable to distinguish a doctor who knows
        the business of his art from one who does not know but pretends or
        thinks he does, and any other person who has knowledge of anything at
        all: one will only distinguish one's fellow-artist, as craftsmen usually
        can.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently, he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then what benefit, I asked, Critias, can we still look for from
        temperance, if it is like that? For if, as we began by assuming, the
        temperate man knew what he knew and what he did not know, and that he
        knows the one and does not know the other, and if he were able to
        observe this same condition in bother man, it would be vastly to our
        benefit, we agree, to be temperate; since we should pass all our lives,
        both we who had temperance and all the rest who were governed by us,
      </p>

      <p>
        without error. For neither should we ourselves attempt to do what we did
        not know, instead of finding out those who knew and placing the matter
        in their hands, nor should we permit others under our governance to do
        anything but what they were likely to do aright; and they would do that
        when they had knowledge of it; and so it would be that a house which was
        ordered, or a state which was administered, as temperance bade, and
        everything else
      </p>

      <p>
        that was ruled by temperance, could not but be well ordered; for with
        error abolished, and rightness leading, in their every action men would
        be bound to do honorably and well under such conditions, and those who
        did well would be happy. Did we not so speak of temperance, I said,
        Critias, when we remarked how great a boon it was to know what one knows
        and what one does not know?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        To be sure we did, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Whereas now, I went on, you see that nowhere can any such science be
        found.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I see, he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then may we say, I asked, that there is this good point in the knowledge
        of knowledge and of lack of knowledge, which we now find to be what
        temperance is, that he who has it will not only learn more easily
        whatever he learns, but will perceive everything more plainly, since
        besides the particular things that he learns he will behold the science;
        and hence he will probe more surely the state of other men respecting
        the things which he has learnt himself, while those who probe without
        such knowledge will do it more feebly and poorly? Are these, my friend,
        the kind of advantages that we shall gain
      </p>

      <p>
        from temperance? But are we really looking at something greater, and
        requiring it to be something greater than it really is?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Probably, he replied, that is so.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>I daresay, I said; and I daresay also our
        inquiry has been worthless. And this I conclude, because I observe
        certain strange facts about temperance, if it is anything like that. For
        suppose, if you please, we concede that there may possibly be a science
        of science, and let us grant, and not withdraw, our original proposition
        that temperance is the knowledge of what one knows and does not know;
      </p>

      <p>
        granting all this, let us still more thoroughly inquire whether on these
        terms it will be of any profit to us. For our suggestion just now, that
        temperance of that sort, as our guide in ordering house or state, must
        be a great boon, was not, to my thinking, Critias, a proper admission.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How so? he asked.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Because, I replied, we too tightly admitted that it would be a great
        boon to mankind if each of us should do what he knows, but should place
        what he did not know in the hands of others who had the knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, was that, he asked, not a proper admission?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Not to my mind, I answered.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        In very truth, your words are strange! he said, Socrates.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, by the Dog, I said, and they strike me too in the same way; and it
        was in view of this, just now, that I spoke of strange results that I
        noticed, and said I feared we were not inquiring rightly. For in truth,
        let temperance be ever so much what we say it is, I see nothing
      </p>

      <p>
        to show what good effect it has on us.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        How so? he asked: tell us, in order that we on our side may know what
        you mean.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        I expect, I said, I am talking nonsense: but still one is bound to
        consider what occurs to one, and not idly ignore it, if one has even a
        little concern for oneself.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And you are quite right, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Hear then, I said, my dream, whether it has come through horn or through
        ivory. Suppose that temperance were such as we now define her,
      </p>

      <p>
        and that she had entire control of us: must it not be that every act
        would be done according to the sciences, and no one professing to be a
        pilot when he was not would deceive us, nor would a doctor, nor a
        general, nor anyone else pretending to know something he did not know,
        go undetected; and would not these conditions result in our having
        greater bodily health than we have now, safety in perils of the sea and
        war, and skilful workmanship in all our utensils, our clothes,
      </p>

      <p>
        our shoes, nay, everything about us, and various things besides, because
        we should be employing genuine craftsmen? And if you liked, we might
        concede that prophecy, as the knowledge of what is to be, and temperance
        directing her, will deter the charlatans, and establish the true
        prophets as our prognosticators. Thus equipped, the human race would
        indeed act and live
      </p>

      <p>
        according to knowledge, I grant you (for temperance, on the watch, would
        not suffer ignorance to foist herself in and take a hand in our labors),
        but that by acting according to knowledge we should do well and be
        happy—this is a point which as yet we are unable to make out, my dear
        Critias.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But still, he replied, you will have some difficulty in finding any
        other fulfillment of welfare if you reject the rule of knowledge.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then inform me further, I said, on one more little matter. Of what is
        this knowledge? Do you mean of shoe-making?
      </p>

      <p>
        Good heavens, not I!
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, of working in brass?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, in wool, or in wood, or in something else of that sort?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, indeed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then we no longer hold, I said, to the statement that he who lives
        according to knowledge is happy; for these workers, though they live
        according to knowledge, are not acknowledged by you to be happy: you
        rather delimit the happy man, it seems to me, as one who lives according
        to knowledge about certain things. And I daresay you are referring to my
        instance of a moment ago, the man who knows
      </p>

      <p>
        all that is to come, the prophet. Do you refer to him or to someone
        else?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Yes, I refer to him, he said, and someone else too.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Whom? I asked. Is it the sort of person who might know, besides what is
        to be, both everything that has been and now is, and might be ignorant
        of nothing? Let us suppose such a man exists: you are not going to tell
        me, I am sure, of anyone alive who is yet more knowing than he.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, indeed.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then there is still one more thing I would fain know: which of the
        sciences is it that makes him happy? Or does he owe it to all of them
        alike?
      </p>

      <p>
        By no means to all alike, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But to which sort most? One that gives him knowledge of what thing,
        present, past or future? Is it that by which he knows draught-playing?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Draught-playing indeed! he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, reckoning?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well, health?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        More likely, he said.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And that science to which I refer as the most likely, I went on, gives
        him knowledge of what?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Of good, he replied, and of evil.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Vile creature! I said, you have all this time been dragging me round and
        round, while concealing the fact that the life according to knowledge
        does not make us do well and be happy, not even
      </p>

      <p>
        if it be knowledge of all the other knowledges together, but only if it
        is of this single one concerning good and evil. For, Critias, if you
        choose to take away this science from the whole number of them, will
        medicine any the less give us health, or shoemaking give us shoes, or
        weaving provide clothes, or will the pilot's art any the less prevent
        the loss of life at sea, or the general's in war?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        None the less, he replied.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But, my dear Critias, to have any of these things well
      </p>

      <p>
        and beneficially done will be out of our reach if that science is
        lacking.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        That is true.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And that science, it seems, is not temperance, but one whose business is
        to benefit us; for it is not a science of sciences and lack of sciences,
        but of good and evil: so that if this is beneficial, temperance must be
        something else to us.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        But why, he asked, should not it be beneficial? For if temperance is
        above all a science of the sciences,
      </p>

      <p>
        and presides too over the other sciences, surely she will govern this
        science of the good, and so benefit us.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        And give us health also? I asked: will she, and not medicine, do this?
        And will the several works of the other arts be hers, and not the
        particular works of each art? Have we not constantly protested that she
        is only knowledge of knowledge and of lack of knowledge, and of nothing
        else? Is not that so?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Apparently it is.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then she will not be a producer of health?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        No, indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        For health, we said, belongs to another art, did we not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        We did.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nor of benefit, my good friend; for this work, again, we assigned to
        another art just now, did we not?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Certainly.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then how will temperance be beneficial, if it produces no benefit?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        By no means, Socrates, as it seems.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So do you see, Critias, how all the time I had good reason for my fear,
        and fair ground for the reproach I made against myself, that my inquiry
        regarding temperance was worthless? For I cannot think that what is
        admitted to be the noblest thing in the world
      </p>

      <p>
        would have appeared to us useless if I had been of any use for making a
        good search. But now, you see, we are worsted every way, and cannot
        discover what thing it can possibly be to which the lawgiver gave this
        name, temperance. And yet we have conceded many points which were not
        deducible from our argument. For you know we conceded that there was a
        science of science, when the argument was against it and would not
        agree; and we further conceded that
      </p>

      <p>
        this science could know the works also of the other sciences, when the
        argument was against this too, in order to make out that the temperate
        man had a knowledge of what he knew and did not know, so as to know that
        he knew the one and did not know the other. And we made this concession
        in a really magnificent manner, without considering the impossibility of
        a man knowing, in some sort of way, things that he does not know at all;
        for our admission says that he knows that he does not know them; and
        yet, in my opinion, there can be nothing more irrational than this.
        Nevertheless, although it has found us so simple-minded
      </p>

      <p>
        and tractable, the inquiry remains quite incapable of discovering the
        truth, but has utterly flouted it by most impudently showing us the
        inutility of that which we had been ever so long assuming, by our joint
        admissions and fictions, to be the meaning of temperance. Now, so far as
        I am concerned, I am not particularly distressed: but for your sake, I
        said, Charmides, I am seriously distressed to think that you, with your
        goodly form and
      </p>

      <p>
        most temperate soul besides, are to have no profit or advantage from the
        presence of that temperance in all your life. And I am still more
        distressed about the charm which I learnt from the Thracian, that I
        should have spent so much pains on a lesson which has had such a
        worthless effect. Now I really do not think that this can be the case,
        but rather that I am a poor hand at inquiring; for temperance I hold to
        be a great good, and you to be highly blessed,
      </p>

      <p>
        if you actually have it. See now whether you have it, and are in no need
        of the charm; for if it is yours, I should rather advise you to regard
        me as a babbler who is unable to argue out any subject of inquiry
        whatsoever, and yourself as advancing in happiness as you advance in
        temperance.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then Charmides said: Why, upon my word, Socrates, I do not know at all
        whether I have it or have it not. For how can I know, when even you two
        are unable
      </p>

      <p>
        to discover what this thing is?—so you say, but of this you do not at
        all convince me—and I quite believe, Socrates, that I do need the charm,
        and for my part I have no objection to being charmed by you every day of
        my life, until you say I have had enough of the treatment.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Very well, said Critias: now, Charmides, if you do this, it will be a
        proof to me of your temperance—if you submit to be charmed by Socrates
        and do not forsake him through thick and thin.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Count on me to follow, he said, and not forsake him;
      </p>

      <p>
        for it would ill become me to disobey you, my guardian, and refuse to do
        your bidding.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Well now, he said, I bid you.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then I will do as you say, he replied, and will start this very day.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        There, there, I said, what are you two plotting to do?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Nothing, replied Charmides; we have made our plot.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        So you will use force, I said, before even allowing me to make my
        affidavit?
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        You must expect me to use force, he replied, since he gives me the
        command: take counsel, therefore, on your side, as to what you will do
      </p>

      <p>
        But that leaves no room, I said, for counsel; for if once you set about
        doing anything and use force, no man alive will be able to withstand
        you.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then do not you, he said, withstand me.
        <span className="bigBlank"/>
        Then I will not withstand you, I replied.
      </p>
    </>
  );
